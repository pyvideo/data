  "summary": "Managing Identities: LDAP, Google Directory, and Django\n\nUniversities and other enterprises often deploy a complex mix of systems\nfor managing identities and permissions for students, faculty and staff.\nStandard LDAP, Google Apps for Education/Enterprise, Student Information\nSystems, hiring systems, CAS/Single Sign-On, and more must all work\ntogether without conflicts or delays. At the California College of Arts,\nwe've created a Django-based system to help end-users and staff create\nand manage identities, passwords, groups, permissions, and more. Scot\nHacker will demonstrate the system and provide a tour of its strictly\ndecoupled internals. The system is unusual in that it uses almost no\ndata modeling of its own, relying instead on communication via\npython-ldap, Google and Workday APIs, and old-school file shuffling to\nnegotiate communications with other systems.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HIXM/\n",
