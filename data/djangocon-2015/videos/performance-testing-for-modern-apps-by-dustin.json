  "summary": "Performance Testing for Modern Apps\n\nThe performance of your application affects your business more than you might think. Top engineering organizations think of performance not as a nice-to-have, but as a crucial feature of their product. Unfortunately, most engineering teams do not regularly test the performance and scalability of their infrastructure. Dustin Whittle shares the latest techniques and tools for performance testing modern web and mobile applications. Join this session and learn how to capacity plan and evaluate performance and the scalability of the server-side through Siege, Bees with Machine Guns, and Locust.io. We will dive into modern performance testing on the client-side and how to leverage navigation/resource timing apis and tools like Google PageSpeed and SiteSpeed.io to understand the real world performance of your users. We will cover how HTTP2 and modern browsers change the game for performance optimization with new best practices. Take back an understanding of how to automate performance and load testing and evaluate the impact it has on performance and your business.",
