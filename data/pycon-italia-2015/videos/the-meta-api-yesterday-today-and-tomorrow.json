The API allows different parts of the framework such as lookups, queries, forms, admin to understand and use the capabilities of every model.\nAs part of Summer of Code 2014 I refactored and redesigned some core parts of this API and, as the purpose of this talk, I plan on advocating how developers can benefit from this API in numerous ways: from understanding how Django\u2019s model works, to enhancing your application through model introspection.\nMoreover, I will give an overview of how we can create a custom store that can be plugged into Django, together with some code snippets and (maybe) a live demo.\nThis talk is an extension of the talk I did at Django Under the Hood, when the API was not finished yet. Now that the API has landed in master, I will also describe my process in getting involved into the Django community and how easy and rewarding it is to contribute to the project.\nObjectives\n\nGive a brief overview of what the Meta API is, it\u2019s features and what can be done with it\nLook at some of Django\u2019s ORM code: from the model metaclass to the relation graph\nDescribe my experience in creating a custom Meta that talks to GMail through Django\u2019s Model API (demo)\nDefine a small but concise guide on how to contribute to Django\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": [], "copyright_text": "", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxBfDe7wiEo", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pxBfDe7wiEo/maxresdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
