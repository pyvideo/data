In such environments, an entirely different approach and workflow is usually required.", 
  "description": "Heartbleed, Shellshock, POODLE, GHOST\u2026 With severe security vulnerabilities on the rise, how can developers protect the systems used to deploy their applications? Unattended package upgrades can help, but only if they are properly set up and monitored. Some of the challenges include:\r\n\r\n* many popular virtual private server (VPS) providers do not install or enable automatic security updates in their OS images\r\n* \u201cunattended-upgrades\u201d on Debian-based systems installs automatic security updates but does not actually enable them, potentially putting unsuspecting users at risk\r\n* some security updates (e.g., kernel-level) require a server reboot to take effect, and yet users often don\u2019t realize this until the next time they log in, resulting in a system that is vulnerable in the interim\r\n",
