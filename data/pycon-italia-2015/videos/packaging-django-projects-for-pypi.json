  "description": "Packaging Python libraries and Django apps has become easier. Packaging Django projects? Not there yet. This talk will cover the uncharted territory of Django project packaging, covering topics like: optimal file layout, user overridable settings, auto admin user creation, automated project initial setup like creation of Django\u2019s secret keys and some PyPI hacks not for the Python developer with easily to upset stomach :) \nAttendees will get the knowledge needed to package their Django projects and avoid some unforeseen problems, why the default Django project file structure is not suited for packaging, and some other project pain points. \n",
