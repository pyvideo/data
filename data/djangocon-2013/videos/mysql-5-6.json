Abstract\n\nMySQL is the ubiquitous web database but many developers are unaware of\nnew features found in the later releases. This session will cover the\nadvancements MySQL has made in version 5.6 and show how these new\nfeatures can make your life easier. See how Global Transaction IDs and\nsimple Python scripts (MySQL Utilities) can be used to replicate slave\nservers from a master and provide automatic fail over if the master\ndies. Discover how the improved optimizer provides better performance,\nhandles sub-queries, and provides more tuning possibilities. New dynamic\ntable definitions make schema changes less onerous. Discover how a NoSQL\ninterface via memcached provides key/value pair access to data and SQL\naccess. The new performance schema provides more insights into system\ntuning to eek out the last bit of performance. All that and more in less\nthan an hour.\n",
