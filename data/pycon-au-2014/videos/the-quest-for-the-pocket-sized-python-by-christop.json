  "description": "Python's already a language of choice for developers on the web, in\nscience, and on the desktop. In the meantime, the world of Mobile\ncomputing has exploded in the last couple of years, and developers\ntargetting Android, iOS, and other Mobile platforms are writing their\napps in Java, Objective-C, JavaScript... but definitely not Python.\n\nBut Python's a great language for solving the sort of problems that are\nposed in Mobile development time -- speedy development cycles, 20 years\nworth of libraries for solving many tasks that you throw at it, and a\nready-made community to help developers. So why aren't we using Python?\n\nThis talk surveys the current landscape of Python on the major Mobile\nplatforms, and ways you can start targeting Mobile platforms with your\nPython code. We'll look at considerations for Mobile web development,\nthe state of Python-based mobile toolkits, and progress towards\nPython-coded native UIs.\n",
