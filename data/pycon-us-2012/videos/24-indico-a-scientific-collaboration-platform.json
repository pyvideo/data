  "description": "Indico is an open source content management system developed at the European\nOrganization for Nuclear Research (CERN) and currently used in more than 90\nscientific institutions world-wide. Indico provides a multitude of features to\nconference/meeting organizers, merging the capabilities of a powerful CMS with\na calendaring layer, thus allowing users to keep track of past and future\nmeetings, and to quickly access all the resources concerning a particular\nevent. Other very useful features include:\n\n  * Conference registration & e-payment integration; \n  * Paper/abstract reviewing; \n  * Integration with chat (XMPP) systems; \n  * Integration with videoconferencing/webcasting applications; \n  * Room booking module; \n  * Drag&drop; timetable editing; \n  * Event reminders & alarms (scheduler); \n  * Extensible via plugin subsystem; \n\nAt CERN alone, Indico serves a community of around 10.000 users, with ~15.000\ndifferent visitors per day (~1 M hits). It hosts more than 150.000 events,\nmade of around 700.000 individual contributions/talks and ~900.000 files. It\nhas become part of \"CERN speech\" - \"look it up on Indico\" is almost as obvious\nas \"Google it\" around here.\n\nBut Indico is as well an indispensable tool in the realm of High Energy\nPhysics, going far beyond the borders of this organization. Institutions such\nas Fermilab, MIT and IHEP (China) are using it for their own\nmeetings/conferences.\n\nThe system is fully written in Python and JavaScript, using ZODB as its\ndatabase back-end. It is a perfect example of how Python-related technologies\ncan be used to build powerful web applications that empower scientific\nresearch and collaboration.\n\n",
