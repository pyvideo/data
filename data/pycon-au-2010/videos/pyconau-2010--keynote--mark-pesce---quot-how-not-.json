  "description": "PyConAU 2010 KeyNote\n\nPresented by Mark Pesce\n\nAlthough Mark Pesce does know Python, he doesn't consider himself any sort of\nexpert so he won't be talking about Python, except to whinge that his friends\npick on him for choosing a language which uses whitespace as syntax. Try as he\nmight, he can't get his friends to see the logic of this - even though they\nalways pretty-print their own code, in whatever language they write. Go\nfigure. So, Mark will not be talking about that. What will Mark be talking\nabout? Well, um, err... (sound of shuffling papers) ...oh, yeah, here it is:\n'Mark Pesce will be talking about stuff. And things. And how great it all is.\nNo, really. You'll see. Promise.' ? Mark is best-known as the co-inventor of\nVRML, and as panelist/judge on ABC's \"The New Inventors\". The author of five\nbooks and numerous articles, he has a monthly column in NETT magazine, is a\nfrequent contributor to ABC Unleashed, and is a sought-after commentator on\nboth radio and television. Since 2006, Pesce has held an Honorary Appointment\nin the Digital Cultures Program at the University of Sydney.\n\n[NOTES: ~10 secs lost audio at start]\n\n",
