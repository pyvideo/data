  "description": "OGRE is an asymmetric board game pitting a futuristic fighting force of\ninfantry and armor against a single, massive, artificially intelligent\ncyber tank. Figuring out a winning strategy was difficult, so I taught\nmy computer how to play the game, and learn to play it better using\nPython.\n\nSource code available at: https://github.com/gar0u/ogre-ai\n",
