  "summary": "An Open Source System for De-identification and Use of Medical Images\nfor Research\n\nAuthors: Miller, Jeffrey, Center for Biomedical Informatics, The\nChildren's Hospital of Philadelphia\n\nTrack: Medical Imaging\n\nMedical images captured from X-ray, MRI, CT, and ultrasound modalities\nrepresent a wealth of data for clinical researchers. Direct access to\nimaging studies establishes a greater opportunity for research purposes\nthan a text-only system. However, imaging data can be difficult to work\nwith outside of clinical systems and can contain Protected Health\nInformation (PHI) in diverse and unexpected locations, presenting a\nbarrier for multi-institutional, collaborative research. While there are\nexisting integration solutions, such as the Clinical Trials Processor,\nthey do not provide for manual curation of images to screen for\nrelevancy and PHI, a crucial step for using images within a research\napplication. To address these issues, we developed a system for the\nend-to-end provisioning of de-identified image studies. This includes a\nDjango app for users to review and record metadata for each study, a\npipeline for anonymizing and provisioning images to a production image\narchive, and finally an application for viewing images in the browser as\npart of a research application. We take advantage of the Python Ruffus\npipeline framework and the PyDICOM library to orchestrate the work of\nmoving, anonymizing, and annotating millions of files in a repeatable\nand auditable manner. This workflow has been used to integrate images\ninto AudGenDB (http://audgendb.chop.edu), a publicly available hearing\nimpairment research database. The results of the AudGenDB image\nintegration enables researchers to visualize and assess images in direct\ncontext with clinical and genetic variables for research subjects.
