  "summary": "Authors: Kridler, Nicholas, Accretive Health\n\nTrack: General\n\nBits are bits. Whether you are searching for whales in audio clips or\ntrying to predicit hospitalization rates based on insurance claims, the\npro- cess is the same: clean the data, generate features, build a model,\nand iter- ate. Better features lead to a better model, but without\ndomain expertise it is often difficult to extract those features.\nNumpy/Scipy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Sci-kit Learn provide an excellent\nframework for data anal- ysis and feature discovery. This is evidenced\nby high performing models in the Heritage Health Prize and the\nMarinexplore Right Whale Detec- tion challenge. In both competitions,\nthe largest performance gains came from identifying better features.\nThis required being able to repeatedly visualize and characterize model\nsuccesses and failures. Python provides this capability as well as the\nability to rapidly implement and test new features. This talk will\ndiscuss how Python was used to develop competi- tive predictive models\nbased on derived features discovered through data analysis.\n",
