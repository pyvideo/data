  "title": "Julia: A Fast Dynamic Language for Technical Computing", 
  "summary": "", 
  "description": "Julia is a dynamic language designed for technical applications and high\nperformance. Its design is based on a sophisticated but unobtrusive type\nsystem, type inference, multiple dispatch instead of class-based OO, and a\ncode generator based on LLVM. These features work together to run high-level\ncode efficiently even without type declarations. At the same time, the type\nsystem provides useful expressiveness for designing libraries, enables forms\nof metaprogramming not traditionally found in dynamic languages, and creates\nthe possibility of statically compiling whole programs and libraries. This\ncombination of high performance and expressiveness makes it possible for most\nof Julia's standard library to be written in Julia itself, with an interface\nto call existing C and Fortran libraries.\n\nWe will discuss some ways that Python and Julia can interoperate, and compare\nJulia's current capabilities to Python and NumPy.\n\n",
