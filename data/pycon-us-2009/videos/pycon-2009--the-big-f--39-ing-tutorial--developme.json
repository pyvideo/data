  "description": "The Big F'ing Tutorial: Development Using repoze.bfg Web Framework (Part 1 of\n3)\n\n  \nPresented by Chris McDonough\n\n  \nAre you a Python web developer who thinks there might be some great stuff\nhidden away in Zope but you consider it inaccessible to you because you feel\nthat Zope imposes too many foreign concepts for your tastes? Are you a more-\nor-less happy Zope developer that has the nagging feeling that much of Zope is\nunnecessary \"baggage\" on your current project? Maybe you're a Plone developer\nwho feels that Plone is unsuitable for one of your current projects because\nit's too complicated? This tutorial will present everything you need to know\nabout repoze.bfg, a small Python web framework in the spirit of Pylons. The\ngoals of repoze.bfg are simplicity, familiarity to Zope programmers (but no\nZope experience is required), execution speed, and complete, comprehensive,\nand up-to-date documentation. In this tutorial, we'll explain the core\nconcepts in repoze.bfg, then we'll lead a guided development session where we\nmake a small application using the framework. We'll also cover packaging and\ndeployment of the application. Questions are highly encouraged during the\npresentation.\n\n  \n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: ]\n\n",
