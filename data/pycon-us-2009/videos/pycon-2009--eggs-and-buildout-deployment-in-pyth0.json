  "description": "  \nPuzzled about Python eggs and packages? Wondering how to repeatably pull\ntogether collections of packages into standalone development, testing and\ndeployment environments, all while managing inter-dependencies? In this\nparticipatory tutorial, we'll start with distutils, walk through using eggs in\nthe cheeseshop and creating your own eggs, touch a bit on using virtualenv to\nset up a development environment, and then dig into using zc.buildout to\nrigorously control assembly specifications, with build recipes, versioning and\ndependency management. We'll close by showing how to create your own recipes.\nAttendees are strongly encouraged to bring a laptop or partner with someone\nwho does.\n\n",
