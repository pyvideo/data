Our Top-level domains are shortened english\nwords. Our programming languages--Python in particular--try to emulate English\nwords and grammar.\n\nFirmly in place in this world for many years, my first attempt to translate a\npre-existing site came with a high sticker shock of nuanced difficulty. This\ntalk covers all the lessons I learned in taking a fully-fleshed web app with\nno translation (and a programmer with no translation experience) to being\ncompletely translated.\n\n# Talk Overview\n\n  1. Introduction to Translation\n    1. Overview of gettext\n    2. Brief history of a translation\n      1. Add gettext calls\n      2. `django-admin.py makemessages`\n      3. Ship po file to translation service\n      4. Receive file back\n      5. Compile\n      6. Fin\n    3. gettext vs gettext_lazy\n  2. Batteries Included\n    1. gettext Python calls\n    2. Middleware\n    3. template tags\n      1. trans vs. blocktrans\n    4. Anti-patterns of the battery included use.\n      1. Heavy whitespace in blocktrans\n      2. Monster-sized translations\n  3. The best laid plans of mice and men...\n    1. Problems that get in the way of A history of a translation.\n      1. Realize half the site is still untranslated\n      2. Edit out the translations you already had translated to avoid re-curring costs\n      3. Have the product adjust so two words change\n      4. Realize common text that's in the database\n      5. Fin?\n    2. Patterns and tools to help\n      1. `poxx.py` and the idea of a 'canonical' po file.\n      2. `dbgettext`\n      3. Wholly-translated template files (translate_include, trans_render)\n  4. Advanced Translation Technique\n    1. While undocumented, translation backend is pretty darn flexible and the source code is a treasure trove to make 'impossible' use cases not too bad.\n    2. Overview of how the translation service works behind the scenes\n      1. `_translation` thread local\n      2. Merged translations (root->app->default)\n      3. Sessions vs. Accept-Language\n      4. Middleware and Context processors\n    3. Example of advanced translation code: Multi-tenancy translation.\n      1. Translating some sites, not translating others\n      2. Translating Site A one way, Site B another\n      3. Using an English translation for duct-tape and profit.\n  5. Why Django's i18n sucks.\n    1. In the vein of the \"Django Sucks\" Key note. It doesn't really, but it could use some changes--from minor to major.\n    2. Why .po Files are archaic and limited.\n    3. What we can do to improve for 1.5 and beyond.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": ["django", "internationalization"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZHZWfx60Y", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "Coming from a speaker who escaped a notion to \"why would we need to\ntranslate?\" this talk aims to show what actually goes into translating a\nwebsite or app using Django's Internationalization tools.
