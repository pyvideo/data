This talk will explain how Twisted helps us keep track of them.\n\nOutline\n\nAlthough we don't use it for the core web application, most other places in\nLaunchpad that have to deal with concurrency issues do it using Twisted. This\ntalk will survey these areas and talk about issues we've found and design\npatterns we've found helpful.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor.
