This talk will describe the course and student outcomes.\n\nOutline\n\nThe talk will cover the following topics: - the problems of teaching and\nlearning programming - does language make a difference? - why Python is a good\nchoice for a first language - the structure of the course - things that worked\nwell, and things that didn't - what students thought about it - impact on\nlearning Java in the second semester - changes for 2010 Note: this is a\npreliminary outline, it's likely that it will change somewhat before the\nconference.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor. Slides are hard to read.]\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": ["education", "kiwipycon", "kiwipycon2009"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Kiwipycon-BrendanMcCaneIntroductoryProgrammingWithPython306-471.jpg", "video_flv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/kiwi-pycon-2009/124_brendan-mccane-introductory-programming-with-python.flv"}
