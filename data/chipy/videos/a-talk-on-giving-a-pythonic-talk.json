  "description": "Xan Vongsathorn and Catherine Vongsathorn will be giving a talk about\ntalks. It turns out that many of python's core principles apply very\nwell to presentations -- or for that matter, communication more\ngenerally -- which may be why we like python so much. Xan and Catherine\nwant to get people excited not only about giving talks but also about\nusing them to *actually communicate*. You don\u2019t have to be an expert,\nnor do you need natural talent, to give a good talk; this metatalk will\ndiscuss guiding principles that set effective presentations apart and\ncan be applied to any technical talk.\n",
