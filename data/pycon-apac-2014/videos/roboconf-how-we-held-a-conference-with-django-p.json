Roboconf is the home-made solution we've brought up: a conference operation site built upon Django, with issue tracking, document organizing, notifications, and staff management all in one place. In this session, I'll describe situations we faced when organizing SITCON 2013, how Roboconf got itself implemented, what difference it has made throughout the process, and crazy stuff other folks at SITCON built around this system.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the speaker\r\n\r\nLaw student at NTU, Administration Lead at SITCON '13/'14, open source advocate.\r\n\r\nRSChiang\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u5c31\u8b80\u65bc\u81fa\u7063\u5927\u5b78\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5b78\u7cfb\uff0c\u5728 SITCON 2013\u30012014 \u64d4\u4efb\u884c\u653f\u7d44\u9577\uff1b\u539f\u5148\u662f\u500b\u62ff\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u505a\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u666e\u901a\u9ad8\u4e2d\u751f\uff0c\u53bb\u5e74\u6691\u5047\u7684\u67d0\u5929\u7a81\u7136\u8f49\u8077\u6210\u9375\u76e4\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4eba\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u5617\u8a66\u5728\u5b78\u6821\u63a8\u5ee3\u958b\u6e90\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5927\u6982\u662f\u70ba\u4e86\u4e0d\u8f9c\u8ca0\u723a\u723a\u7684\u540d\u8072\u5427\u3002", "video_mp4_url": "", "tags": [], "copyright_text": "youtube", "related_urls": [{"url": "https://github.com/sitcon-tw/staff.sitcon.org", "description": "Roboconf source code"}], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X755DmpkpbU", "video_webm_url": "", "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X755DmpkpbU/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": ""}
