  "description": "The Python and the Elephant: Large Scale Natural Language Processing with NLTK\nand Dumbo\n\n  \nPresented by Nitin Madnani (University of Maryland, College Park); Dr. Jimmy J\nLin (University of Maryland)\n\n  \nA practical look at NLTK and Dumbo, python-powered and open-source toolkits\nand APIs for processing natural language on a large scale.\n\n  \nFor people like us who make a living trying to make a computer \"understand\"\nhuman language, Python is a very powerful language, given its rapid\nprototyping abilities, native unicode support and a stellar standard library.\nThis relationship has been strengthened further by an open-source, python-\nbased Natural Language ToolKit ([www.nltk.org](http://www.nltk.org/)) which is\nbeing widely used in the community for both teaching and research purposes and\ngaining traction in the general Python community as well\n([www.nltk.org/book](http://www.nltk.org/book)). Recently, the Python\ncommunity has seen the release of Dumbo ([http://wiki.github.com/klbostee/dumb\no](http://wiki.github.com/klbostee/dumbo)), an open-source, python-based\ncloud-computing API (based on Hadoop) via the hands of Klaas Bosteels.\n\n  \nIn this talk, we show how the amalgamation of Python, NLTK and Dumbo can allow\nfor very large-scale natural language processing efficiently and elegantly.\n\n",
