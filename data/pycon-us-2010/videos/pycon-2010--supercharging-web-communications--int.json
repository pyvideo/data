Luckily, Salesforce.com has an\nelegant and powerful SOAP API. This presentation will introduce an example of\nusing the Python wrapper for the Salesforce.com API (Beatbox) in an\ninteractive website. While the library itself is powerful and can be used in\ncustom Python applications, the Python community can also leverage the\nadvanced integration between the Plone Content Management System (CMS) and\nsalesforce.com. We will demonstrate how a Plone website can post forms,\necommerce transactions, and event RSVPs to salesforce. Additionally, we will\nshow how developers can make Salesforce.com data interactive in a Plone\nwebsite.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/346_supercharging-web-communications-integrating-python-based-apps-with-salesforce-com-crm-152.m4v", "tags": ["cms", "crm", "plone", "pycon", "pycon2010", "web"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": 234819947, "video_ogv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/346_supercharging-web-communications-integrating-python-based-apps-with-salesforce-com-crm-152.ogv", "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2010SuperchargingWebCommunicationsIntegratingPythonbas271.png", "video_flv_url": null}
