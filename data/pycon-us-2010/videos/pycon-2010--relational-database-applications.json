  "description": "Turbogears Database Applications (Relational Database Applications)\n\nPresented by Chris Perkins\n\nTurboGears2 provides a rich toolset to provide developers with a platform for\ndeveloping web applications with existing databases. This \u00e2\u20ac\u0153un-tutorial\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\nhas a simple goal. The participants may bring in their own databases, and we\nwill explore how TurboGears can use this database to create a working web\napplication. If the student does not want to use her own database, one will be\nprovided. This tutorial will focus on the TurboGears Admin system, along with\nrelational databases.\n\nThis tutorial is intended to be an un-tutorial. The idea is simple. Bring a\npublic database, (or 4) and share with the class as we explore the new admin-\nlevel RESTful features that TurboGears2 employs.\n\nAt the end of the class, the goal is for everyone to have a working TG2\napplication, with a working admin, at least one customized form or table,\nbased on a database they, or another student brought to class.\n\nRequirements\n\nLaptop with Python 2.5 or 2.6 installed. Database system of your choice\n(Postgres, Sqlite, MySQL) Python drivers for your desired database system\ninstalled. (psychopg2, pg8000, pysqlite, mysql-python)\n\n",
