Where does competition help and where does it hamper?\n\n  \nIn this interactive talk I'll highlight the main strengths of each of the\nPython interpreters. Furthermore, I'll discuss ways to leverage Python\ninterpreters in a co-operative way, discuss challenges, projects and issues\nahead and also briefly highlight 'execnet', one my own projects for bridging\n(Any) Python to (Any) Python. This is also the first time i am going to try\nout a new and funvisual presentation technique after several years of having\ndone mostly text-based ones\n\n",
