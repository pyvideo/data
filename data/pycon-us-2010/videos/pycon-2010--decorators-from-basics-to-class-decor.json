  "description": "Decorators from Basics to Class Decorators to Decorator Libraries\n\n  \nPresented by Charles Merriam\n\n  \nDecorators simplify design and improve readability and reliability. This\ntutorial starts from the beginning with basic decorators, showing how simple\ntasks like restricting administration functions are clearer and more readable\nwith decorators, and exactly how the decorators work. A simple library of\ndecorators for tracing, logging, and caching results is presented. This leads\ninto writing your own decorators and parameterized decorators either from\nscratch or by using libraries like Simionato's Decorator Decorator and\n\"@call_before(fn)\". Finally, using Python 3.x class decorators in place of\nmetaclasses for most common dictionary modifications is covered.\n\n  \n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Missing about 1 minute at start, because of technical\nproblems.]\n\n",
