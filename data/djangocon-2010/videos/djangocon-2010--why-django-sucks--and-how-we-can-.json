  "description": "Why Django Sucks, and How We Can Fix It\n\nPresented by Eric Florenzano\n\nEric Florenzano trolls DjangoCon. He identifies problems with Django\nranging from app structure, to settings, to the development process, to\nthe community, and more. Some of the problems he identifies have been\naround since the beginning, and some are emerging as Django matures.\nIt's not all gloom\u2014the latter half of the talk focuses on proposals on\nhow to tackle these issues that face Django.\n\nAbstract\n\nThis talk focuses on real problems that people face when using Django\nevery day. It dives down and attempts to find root causes for each of\nthese problems. Essentially, what are the things that suck about Django?\n\nThen the talk walks point-by-point for each of the things that suck, and\nprovides suggestions for actions that the Django community can take to\nmake them suck less.\n\nThe goal here is to start a discussion, to bring to light the problems\nthat tend to be ignored, and to have a little fun in the process.\n",
