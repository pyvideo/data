  "description": "State of Pinax\n\nBrian Rosner\n\nPinax is a platform for rapidly building websites with Django. This talk will\ncover what has happened with Pinax over the past year and where it will go in\nthe future.\n\nAbstract\n\nPinax is a platform for rapidly building websites. It leverages Django in as\nmany ways possible. It handles the parts which are common amongst many sites\nleaving you mostly worrying about what makes your site different.\n\nThe beginning of the talk will cover how Pinax started and where the project\nis today, and review some sites built with Pinax over the past year.\n\nThe Pinax team has been hard at work with 0.9. This talk will highlight the\nimportant improvements and fixes made to Pinax since 0.7:\n\n  * removed requirement of pinax-boot.py \n  * enabled pip install Pinax \n  * upgraded to Django 1.2 \n  * improved account, waiting list and groups \n  * introduced new starter projects \n\nThe \"must-haves\" for the next release are to add or improve:\n\n  * per-object permissions \n  * e-mail backends \n  * friends and invitations \n  * tagging (move to django-taggit) \n  * notifications / activity streams \n  * wikis (change over wiki to wakawaka) \n  * blogs (change over blog to biblion) \n  * photos \n  * profiles (to give a good answer to: \"How do I add more fields to a user?\") \n\nThis talk will cover starter projects, and the layer zero concept implemented\nin Pinax by default. The talk will demo a couple starter projects created\nusing setup_project.\n\nFinally, the talk will cover some relevant stats over the past year, and a\nroadmap for the future.\n\n",
