  "description": "Large Problems in Django, Mostly Solved\n\nPresented by Eric Holscher\n\nThis talk is based on my popular series of blog posts highlighting\napplications from the community. I will highlight some of the best\napplications that the Django/Python community has put together, talk about\nplaces that are lacking, and talk about what these popular applications have\nin common.\n\nPart 1\n\nI have written a series of blog posts about \"Large problems\" in the community,\nand how they have been solved by members of our community with reusable apps.\nPreviously I have covered:\n\n  * Delayed Execution \n  * Search \n  * APIs \n  * Documentation \n  * Database Migrations \n\nI will update my thoughts on these issues, as well as talking about a couple\nof other new issues that I think that have been solved in a decent way. These\ninclude:\n\n  * Remote Command Execution \n  * Debugging in Development \n  * Continuous Integration \n\nPart 2\n\nIn this part I will highlight issues that are still headaches for the\nCommunity. These are places where there is a good chance for growth for third\nparty apps, and places where I have personally found some friction in my\ndevelopment. A couple examples of this are:\n\n  * Deployment \n  * Class Based Views / Thread Safety \n  * Debugging Production Environments \n\nPart 3\n\nFrom the above applications that are well done, what makes a popular reusable\napp? This won't be my thoughts, but more looking at apps that have been\nsuccessful and trying to see what they have in common. A good app and a good\nreusable app are necessarily different, and I think it will be interesting to\nlook at what traits make reusable apps popular.\n\n[Large problems posts](http://ericholscher.com/tag/largeproblems/)\n\n",
