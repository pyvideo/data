You've tested it, you've released\nit, you've got a few customers... and a few more... and a few more... and now\nyou're having performance problems. What do you do? This talk will look at\nsome performance problems you may experience, and show some simple (and\ncreative) ways to squeeze the most out of your server hardware.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe talk is especially aimed at web developers that haven't got a background\nin computing, but nonetheless have fallen into a web development role. Topics\nwill include:\n\n  * How to work out that you have a problem \n  * Getting computation out of the request/response loop \n  * Caching -- when, how, and problems that caching introduces \n  * Setting up a webserver to avoid deadlocks \n  * Likely causes (and solutions) of database bottlenecks \n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": ["djangocon", "djangocon2010", "performance", "tuning"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": 228877578, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Robertlofthouse-FirstStepsInPerformanceTuning779-385.jpg", "video_flv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/djangocon-2010/57_first-steps-in-performance-tuning.flv"}
