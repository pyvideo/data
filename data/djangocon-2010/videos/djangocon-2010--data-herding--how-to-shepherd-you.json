  "description": "Data Herding: How to Shepherd Your Flock Through Valleys of Darkness\n\nPresented by Brian Luft\n\nLearn how to use common tools like the management shell, django-extensions,\nand iPython to craft an effective workflow whether you're building a new\nschema or migrating from old systems. We'll also look at how to take advantage\nof the latest ORM features.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe presentation would consist of walking through a few example scenarios\nwhere one would deal with processing or converting data in some manner. For\nexample, migrating from a large legacy database often brings a number of\ntedious problems. I would demonstrate how to work in an iterative, repeatable\nstyle using the Django sql management commands, a few iPython tricks, etc.\n\nAnother demonstration would be showing a team workflow for South migrations,\nillustrating how to deal with some common problems that crop up in practice.\n\nThe audience will leave with some solid techniques for dealing with a few\nspecific data management challenges. The unifying philosophy throughout is to\nbreak large, difficult problems into small, repeatable steps and audience\nmembers should also come away knowing how to select tools that help them work\nin this style.\n\n",
