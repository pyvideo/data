  "description": "Learning a new codebase\n\nPresented by Justin Lilly\n\nThis talk will be on methods of reading code for comprehension. While\nthe project will be walking through various third-party Django apps, the\nexperiences and conclusions are drawn from joining a large, existing\nDjango project which lacked documentation.\n\nAbstract\n\nIn the broadest sense, this talk is on how to read code. More than this,\nit is a series of methods and practices which one can follow to get up\nto speed on a new codebase. The subject of this talk will be\nopen-sourced Django projects, but many of the experiences which fuel\nthis talk will be based on joining a new team. It will cover tracing\nexecution paths, finding the more interesting portions of a codebase, as\nwell as how to address any issues you may have found in it.\n",
