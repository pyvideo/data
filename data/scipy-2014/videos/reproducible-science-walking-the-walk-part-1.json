  "summary": "This tutorial will train reproducible research warriors on the practices and tools that make experimental verification possible with an end-to-end data analysis workflow. \u00a0The tutorial will expose attendees to open science methods during data gathering, storage, analysis up to publication into a reproducible article. \u00a0Attendees are expected to have basic familiarity with scientific Python and Git.",
