  "description": "This talk will cover my view of documentation within programming culture\nas it has grown over the years. As a primary person involved with Read\nthe Docs, and Write the Docs, I have seen a lot of angles, and\nappreciate documentation more every year. I believe better documentation\nis a fundamental aspect of how we can improve programming culture, and\nan often misunderstood part of outreach and education. Read the Docs\nstarted in Lawrence, and has grown from there. This seems like the\nperfect venue to wax poetic about why documentation matters, and tell\nthe story of Read the Docs along the way. The Django community is one\nwhere documentation has always been valued, and I think that\nunderstanding how it lead to its success and why it's an important\nvirtue going forward is important. This talk will make you think more\ndeeply about the social impact of documentation, and hopefully make you\nquestion if it should be a higher priority in your development.\n",
