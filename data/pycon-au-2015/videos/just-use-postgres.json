Furthermore, communities such as Hacker News enforce the idea that you must use the latest and coolest technology in order to be a \u2018rockstar\u2019 engineer.\r\n\r\nMarketing buzzwords like \u2018real-time\u2019, \u2018distributed\u2019, \u2018high-availability\u2019, and \u2018schemaless\u2019 impact our design decisions, and the expectation for applications to be \u2018scalable\u2019 often forces developers to prematurely introduce complexity and anti-patterns into their applications by making use of these untested and immature data stores.\r\n\r\nForget about adding the latest trendy data store into your stack; just use Postgres.\r\n\r\nThis talk will explore the capabilities of Postgres 9.4, and various use-cases where you can involve it as your primary datastore. I will cover some of the projects at Heroku where we have used Postgres, such as:\r\n\r\n- Quickly querying over 300M records to get a list of all users on a particular server at a particular point in time.\r\n- Providing almost real-time aggregations of all Heroku customer\u2019s usage.\r\n- Joining 3 different tables on 3 different database servers without any external code.\r\n- Creating a \u2018social graph\u2019 of all of Heroku\u2019s users based on commonly used IP addresses.\r\n- Ensuring that coupon codes are used only once, preventing attackers from exploiting \u2018race condition\u2019 bugs.\r\n\r\n In particular, I will focus on topics such as:\r\n\r\n- Storing, indexing, and querying schemaless data.\r\n- Materialized Views.\r\n- NOTIFY/LISTEN.\r\n- Storing and querying time-series data.\r\n- Updatable views.\r\n- Foreign tables.\r\n- Recursive views.\r\n- Stored functions.\r\n- Range Types\r\n- Partitioning and Sharding data.\r\n\r\nEach topic will include links to sample schemas and iPython notebooks so you can take these examples home with you.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": [], "copyright_text": "creativeCommon", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgcC_bY4rPg", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UgcC_bY4rPg/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
