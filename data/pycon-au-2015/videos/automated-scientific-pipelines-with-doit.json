  "summary": "",
  "description": "Doit is a Python library for task management and automation. It provides\na straightforward Python approach to manage and execute any series of\ninterrelated tasks, such as in scientific data analysis. Doit can be\nused as a command line substitute for Make to drive existing\ntools/applications, or can be integrated directly with your application\nat the Python level. Task automation can be as simple as manually\nspecifying a dictionary of dependencies, target files and actions, or as\ncomplex as automatically determining dependencies and whether a task is\nup to date using arbitrary Python expressions. This talk will give an\noverview of why and how to use doit for your project.\n\nThis talk assumes no particular background except some familiarity with\nPython, but is geared towards a scientific computing audience and will\ntouch on automated data analysis as a motivating example.\n",
