Wouldn't it be nice if we could turn these spreadsheets straight into Python code?\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial we'll use two sets of meta-programming techniques to derive Python code out of semi-formal descriptions: first, to build Django models requiring very detailed validation supplied by the client in a spreadsheet; second, to build a Python API for a hardware device, the description of which is maintained by the engineers in a spreadsheet.\r\n\r\nFor the Pycon attendance, this tutorial has both business value and technical value:\r\n\r\nBusiness value because spreadsheet-driven metaprogramming allows developers to:\r\n\r\n- respond to changes very fast by re-rendering their Python code from the modified spreadsheet descriptions.\r\n- avoid a certain class of human errors unavoidable when transcribing the requirements by hand.\r\n- save time which can be employed in other areas of the project, or with other clients.\r\n- clarify ambiguous specifications by making explicit all programmer's assumptions into the code generator.\r\n\r\nTechnical value because we'll be talking about:\r\n\r\n- api design,\r\n- Django modeling and validation,\r\n- consuming spreadsheets via csv dictreaders and elbow grease,\r\n- writing partially-applied functions via custom classes with a __call__ method,\r\n- implementing fluent apis with table-driven __getattr__ methods,\r\n- implementing iterators with __iter__ and __next__,\r\n- papering over some differences between Python 2 and Python 3 syntax,\r\n- and much, much more.\r\n\r\nWe'll be doing all of it in a hands-on manner, without getting distracted by abstract discussions of Python syntax. There will be some discussions of Python syntax, but they won't be abstract. We'll always have a goal in sight.\r\n\r\nLevel:\r\n\r\nIntermediate. You'll learn some advanced techniques, but all you need to really know in order to follow this tutorial is how lists, dictionaries, iteration and reading files work in Python. \r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n\r\n- Attendees are expected to know basic Python (see above, under \"Level\").\r\n- A laptop and some knowledge of git will be useful for those wanting to follow along, but is not required. You can get a lot out of this tutorial just by watching and paying attention.\r\n\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": [], "copyright_text": "creativeCommon", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmLHqOvbG9M", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DmLHqOvbG9M/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
