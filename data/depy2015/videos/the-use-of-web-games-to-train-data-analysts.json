  "description": "There has been recent work on the taxonomy of games which are based, one\nway or another, on real world data. Typically these games help people\nlearn that data or how to cope with it. The traditional examples are\nsimulation games (flight, driving, etc.), while other games incorporate\ndata in such a way that it is beneficial to learn the real world data in\nthe game play (trivia). These types of data-games commonly have a domain\nspecific focus. We intend to explore the possibility of interactive\ngames which help people to learn data analysis, in general, implementing\nsome such games in python using web2py.\n",
