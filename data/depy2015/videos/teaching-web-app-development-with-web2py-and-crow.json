  "description": "In this talk, we describe how web2py together with crowdsourced grading\nenable teaching web applications at scale. Web2py is unique in allowing\nthe easy packaging and sharing of applications. A student can write a\nweb app, package it into a single file, then share it; other students\ncan with the click of a mouse unpack and load the application, and use\nit. This allows teaching web development in a peer-driven fashion:\nstudents submit solutions to homework assignments, then review and grade\neach other's work, in the process learning from studying the solutions\nthat other students submitted for the same problem. We have successfully\nused this approach at UC Santa Cruz for three years now, in the process\nbuilding a tool, CrowdGrader, for the peer review and grading of the\napplications. The talk will describe the peer-driven approach and the\ntool, and present results on tool accuracy and student satisfaction.\n",
