  "description": "This talk will give on overview over some common problems related to profiling\nand debugging CPython applications (especially desktop-based ones).\n\nThe following subjects will be covered:\n\n  * Debugging of memory/resource leaks (circular references, **del**, weakref, garbage collector, etc.). We will show in details how the memory management of Python objects work and we will show a few tricks to track memory leaks\n  * Python code profiling (profile/hotshots/cProfile, design of small tests, etc.). We will show how to measure, profile, and analyse an application to spot performance problems and solve them.\n  * Post-mortem step-by-step debugging of C/C++ extension under Windows. We will show how to setup Visual Studio for debugging, how to see a traceback in case of an unexpected segfault, and how to further debug and solve the crash.\n\nThis talk is aimed at intermediate Python programmers, who have already\ndeveloped non-trivial Python applications but have never \"jumped through\" the\ninterpreter abstraction layer. If you feel a little lost when you see a\nsegfault from a Python program or you don't have a clear idea how memory is\ncollected in Python, this talk is perfect for you.\n\n",
