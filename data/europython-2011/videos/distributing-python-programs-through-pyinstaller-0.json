The executable can then be packed and shipped in many\ndifferent ways (through installer wizards, deb/rpm packages, etc.).\n\nPyInstaller is a good multi-platform alternative to tools like py2exe and\npy2app, but it found troubles to gain acceptance in a market that seems\nstrongly tied to older tools. Instead, PyInstaller puts forward important new\nfeatures: for instance, it works on the most important desktop platforms\n(Windows, Linux/UNIX, Mac), and it has got an automatic and fully transparent\nsupport for all the workarounds needed to make applications using complex\nlibraries like Matplotlib or PyQt work within a static executable.\n\nIn detail, the following points will be discussed:\n\n  * Distribution of a priopriertary software: initial requests\n  * PyInstaller: how it works (basic tutorial)\n  * The secrets of PyInstaller: technical details\n  * Import hooks: effectively handling third party extensions\n  * Flexibility with PyInstaller: what goes in and what stays out\n  * Linux: static binaries for a single distribution or cross-distributions\n  * Mac: creation of bundles for graphic applications\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": ["matplotlib", "py2exe", "pyqt"], "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRjpZCw8Fg8", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "[EuroPython 2011] Giovanni Bajo - 22 June 2011 in \"Track Lasagne\"\n\n", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/MRjpZCw8Fg8/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
