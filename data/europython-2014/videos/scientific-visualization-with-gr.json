  "summary": "Python developers often get frustrated when managing visualization packages that cover the specific needs in scientific or engineering environments. The [*GR* framework](http://gr-framework.org/) could help. *GR* is a library for visualization applications ranging from publication-quality 2D graphs to the creation of complex 3D scenes and can easily be integrated into existing Python environments or distributions like *Anaconda*.", 
  "description": "Python has long been established in software development departments of research and industry, not least because of the proliferation of libraries such as *SciPy* and *Matplotlib*. However, when processing large amounts of data, in particular in combination with GUI toolkits (*Qt*) or three-dimensional visualizations (*OpenGL*), it seems that Python as an interpretative programming language may be reaching its limits.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*Outline*\r\n\r\n- Introduction (1 min)\r\n    - motivation\r\n- GR framework (2 mins)\r\n    - layer structure\r\n    - output devices and capabilities\r\n- GR3 framework (1 min)\r\n    - layer structure\r\n    - output capabilities (3 mins)\r\n        - high-resolution images\r\n        - POV-Ray scenes\r\n        - OpenGL drawables\r\n        - HTML5 / WebGL\r\n- Simple 2D / 3D examples (2 min)\r\n- Interoperability (PyQt/PySide, 3 min)\r\n- How to speed up Python scripts (4 mins)\r\n    - Numpy\r\n    - Numba (Pro) \r\n- Animated visualization examples (live demos, 6 mins)\r\n    - physics simulations\r\n    - surfaces / meshes\r\n    - molecule viewer\r\n    - MRI voxel data\r\n- Outlook (1 min)\r\n\r\n*Notes*\r\n\r\nLinks to similar talks, tutorials or presentations can be found [here][1]. Unfortunately, most of them are in German language.\r\n\r\nThe GR framework has already been presented in a talk at PyCon DE [2012][2] and [2013][3], during a [poster session][4] at PyCon US 2013, and at [PythonCamps 2013][5] in Cologne. The slides for the PyCon.DE 2013 talk can be found [here][6].\r\n\r\nAs part of a collaboration the GR framework has been integrated into [NICOS][7] (a network-based control system completely written in Python) as a replacement for PyQwt.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://gr-framework.org/\r\n  [2]: https://2012.de.pycon.org/programm/schedule/sessions/54\r\n  [3]: https://2013.de.pycon.org/schedule/sessions/45/\r\n  [4]: https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/158/\r\n  [5]: http://josefheinen.de/rasberry-pi.html\r\n  [6]: http://iffwww.iff.kfa-juelich.de/pub/doc/PyCon_DE_2013\r\n  [7]: http://cdn.frm2.tum.de/fileadmin/stuff/services/ITServices/nicos-2.0/dirhtml/\r\n",
