  "description": "In the technology community at the moment there is a lot of talk about\nhypermedia enabled APIs and Web as an Architecture model.\n\nMore and more applications nowadays try to adopt the loosely coupled and\ndistributed web like architecture by using hypermedia as an engine of\nthe application state.\n\nIn Sky we are successfully implementing this approach for some of our\ncomponents, and we\u2019ve learnt that the major benefit for us is the\nscalability that it offers: as an increasingly expanding business with a\nconstantly growing product portfolio, scalability of all our systems is\ncrucial.\n\nIn this talk I will share some of the things we learnt, I will explain\nwhat hypermedia enabled API means, I will give an example of such an API\nand I will take you through the implementation details and the usage of\nflask, dougrain and HAL in this context.\n\nAlso, I will present a brief comparison with an API that is not\nhypermedia enabled and take you through the advantages of using the\nhypermedia approach.\n",
