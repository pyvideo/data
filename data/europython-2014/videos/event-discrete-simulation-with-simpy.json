They are especially useful if\r\nthe actions are potentially harmful or expensive.\r\n\r\nSimulation is used in various natural scientific and economic areas, e.g., for\r\nthe modeling and study of biological or physical systems, for resource\r\nscheduling and optimization or at the research for the integration of renewable\r\nenergies into the power grid (my personal background). The simulated time can\r\nthereby be seen as continuous or discrete (discrete time or discrete event).\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I want to show why Python is a good choice for implementing\r\nsimulation models and how SimPy can help here.\r\n\r\nStructure of the talk (20min talking + 5min discussion + 5min buffer):\r\n\r\n- Why simulation? (5min)\r\n- History of SimPy (3min)\r\n- How does SimPy work? (9min)\r\n- Conclusion (3min)\r\n\r\nIn the introduction, I\u2019ll briefly explain what simulation is and motivate, why\r\nit is a useful tool.\r\n\r\nThe main part will consist of an introduction and demonstration of SimPy. Since\r\nSimPy is now more then ten years old, I\u2019ll first give a quick overview about\r\nits history and development. Afterwards, I\u2019ll explain SimPy\u2019s concepts and\r\nfeatures by means of simple examples.\r\n\r\nIn the conclusion, I\u2019ll give a short outlook on the future development of\r\nSimPy.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this talk is to create awareness that simulation is a powerful\r\ntool in a lot of domains and to give the audience enough information to ease\r\ntheir first steps.", "video_mp4_url": "", "tags": [], "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk91DoAEcjY", "video_webm_url": "", "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "Often, experiments with real world systems are high-risk, accompanied by high\r\ncosts or not even possible at all.
