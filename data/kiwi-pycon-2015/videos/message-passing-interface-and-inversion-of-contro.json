  "description": "The myriad of methods available for MPI programming is daunting by\nitself, and largely unnecessary. The solutions proposed by the\ndevelopers of MPI and the new languages in this space are all addressing\nthe problem the way it's always been addressed. What I present is a way\nto attack the massively parallel problem that reduces the complexity of\nMPI programming to that of implementing a very simple state machine.\nI've used this combination of MPI and IoC to write state-of-the-art\napplications that run on some of the largest supercomputers around the\nworld.\n",
