  "summary": "",
  "description": "Cython is an optimising static compiler based on Pyrex, created by Greg\nEwing from the university of Canterbury. It bridges the worlds of Python\nand C, letting you write code that runs close to C speed in a syntax\nthat is very close to Python. This talk will show how you can speed up a\ntypical Python program with Cython datatypes. We\u2019ll call C functions\ndirectly, passing NumPy arrays with ease. We\u2019ll see how we can release\nthe global interpreter lock, letting us run multiple threads in parallel\nnear C speeds. We\u2019ll look at Cython\u2019s parallel module for data\nparallelism and compare it to some alternatives and discuss the pros and\ncons.\n",
