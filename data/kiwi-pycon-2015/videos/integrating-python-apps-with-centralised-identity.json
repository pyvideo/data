  "title": "Integrating Python Apps with Centralised Identity Management Systems",
  "summary": "",
  "description": "Most Python web developers are familiar with authentication and\nauthorisation on the open web, but the requirements and technologies\nused inside companies and large organisations are different:\n\n-  Identities and groups are probably stored in an external identity\n   management system's directory rather than in an application's\n   database tables.\n\n-  Authorisation decisions will be based on group membership and\n   policies that are defined outside the application.\n\n-  Users may be expected or required to use a *single sign-on*\n   technology such as Kerberos or SAML to authenticate to applications.\n\nThis talk will familiarise the audience with these technologies and\ndemonstrate how Python web applications can be integrated with an\nidentity management system to meet business requirements while providing\na positive user experience. Particular technologies covered will\ninclude:\n\n-  `FreeIPA <https://www.freeipa.org>`__: an open-source identity\n   management solution, for defining users, groups and authorisation\n   policies\n\n-  `mod\\_auth\\_gssapi <https://github.com/modauthgssapi/mod_auth_gssapi>`__\n   / mod\\_auth\\_kerb: Apache modules for Kerberos authentication\n\n-  `mod\\_lookup\\_identity <http://www.adelton.com/apache/mod_lookup_identity/>`__:\n   Apache module to retrieve user information from a directory\n\nThe talk will conclude with discussion about upcoming Kerberos features,\ntechniques for dealing with multiple authentication methods, and\nprogress in making identity management integration easier for Python\n(and in particular, Django) developers.\n\nPeople developing or deploying Python web applications in business\nenvironments or for large open source projects with centralised identity\nmanagement will get the most out of this talk.\n",
