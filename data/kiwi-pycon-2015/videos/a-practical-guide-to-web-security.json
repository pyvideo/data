  "description": "This presentation is an introduction to securing your Python web\napplication. I am definitely not a security expert, just a developer who\nthinks security should be everyone's job. That's right. It's your\nresponsibility too. Hopefully I can soften the blow by giving you a\nbeginner's guide to security. That's me, the beginner.\n\nWe will pick apart an example Python web application to demonstrate good\nsecurity practices, along with examples and explanations of why they are\nimportant.\n\nI'll cover a few different web security topics:\n\n-  Not trusting any input from your users\n-  Authentication and session management\n-  Using HTTPS effectively\n-  Things not to do in client land\n-  Obvious mistakes\n-  Not so obvious mistakes\n\nIf you have written a web application and not thought twice about\nsecurity, this talk is for you. If you can name the OWASP Top 10, then\nyou can come along anyway and ask me a really tricky question at the\nend.\n",
