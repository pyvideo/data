  "description": "`SolidPython <https://github.com/SolidCode/SolidPython>`__ is a Python\nmodule which allows executed Python to generate OpenSCAD script.\n`OpenSCAD <http://www.openscad.org/>`__ is software for creating solid\n3D CAD models. OpenSCAD is not an interactive modeller, instead it is\nsomething like a 3D-compiler that reads in a script file that describes\nthe object and renders the 3D model from this script file.\n\n`Cura <https://github.com/daid/Cura>`__ is the Python-based user\ninterface to the CuraEngine slicing library, which processes 3D models\ninto 3D printing instructions for various printers.\n\n`BotQueue <https://www.botqueue.com/>`__ is a 3D printing job-control\nservice, allowing remote submission and monitoring of printing jobs to\nany number of printers.\n\nThis talk will take a tour through SolidPython, Cura, and BotQueue\nshowing how Python can help with the design, preparation, and printing\nof your doodad, widget, or dingus.\n",
