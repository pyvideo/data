This talk\nwill examine some recent bugs affecting Django as well as other popular\nframeworks and libraries. We will look at functionality, such as parsing\nof XML, that just doesn't behave as any reasonable person might expect,\nhow this can be misused and what can be done to avoid the pitfalls.\n\n**Slides**\n\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/mike-haworth-surprise-features-you-didnt-ask-for\n",
