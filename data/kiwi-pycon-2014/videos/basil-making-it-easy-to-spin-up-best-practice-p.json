Basil addresses this pain point. Use\ncases include students building basic web apps and experienced devs\ntrying out less familiar web frameworks.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nPython is a great language for web development but spinning up Python\nweb frameworks for development is still not as easy as it could be -\nespecially if you're trying to follow a particular form of best practice\ne.g. altering the standard folder structure, or separating secrets\n(unversioned) from settings (versioned). And even if you are familiar\nwith one framework, it may not be as easy to spin up another one. The\nbasil project is an attempt to address this pain point. Use cases may\ninclude a teaching session where students are learning Python by\nbuilding a basic web application. Or an experienced developer wanting to\ntry out an alternative web framework. The presentation will look at some\nof the challenges involved in designing basil.\n\nThe talk will cover the following topics:\n\n-  standard user experience of setting up a web framework for Python\n   (contrasted with other languages)\n-  the user experience of basil\n-  use cases for basil (new developers, experienced developers,\n   teaching)\n-  existing alternative solutions\n-  benefits of using vagrant\n\n**Slides**\n\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/ben-denham-basil-making-it-easy-to-spin-up-best-practice-python-web-frameworks\n",
