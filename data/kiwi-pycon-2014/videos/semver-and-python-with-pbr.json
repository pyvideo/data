Semver provides simple and robust rules for deciding on\nversion numbers, and I'm in the middle of implementing automation for\nthese in PBR itself, with integration glue to export them in PEP-440,\ndpkg and rpm format. The only dependencies PBR has are git + a recent\npip, so this should be useful for many attendees - and while PBR is an\nOpenStack invention we're very interested in making sure its useful and\nreliable for anyone that wants to use it.\n\n**Slides**\n\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/robert-collins-semver-and-python-with-pbr\n",
