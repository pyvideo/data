What needs to be digitised, what is already\ndigitised and how do we get access to these books. This has been a\njourney of learning the archaic arts of MARC, learning and loving Python\nand working out how to handle large amounts of Library Data. This is\nstill a work in progress, 2 years later and what started as checking\ndata sets against each other in excel, has grown into me falling in love\nwith Dictionary\u2019s (JSON), making Flask web interfaces to explore data,\nMap Reducing data sets, making sweet graphs with MatPlotLib, using\nPython when ever I get a chance and even teaching some of what I have\nlearned to other colleagues.\n\n**Slides**\n\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/greig-roulston-find-all-the-books\n",
