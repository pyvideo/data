  "title": "Geolocation apps with Django (Tyler Savery)",
  "summary": "Latitude, longitude, altitude, and even iBeacons can be leveraged to enable geo-targeted experiences. But how do we build and optimize the server-side components to handle these requirements? Using a combination of libraries and techniques, we will illustrate these concepts. In this discussion everything from map clustering and caching, to distance calculations and polygonal layering will be demonstrated using Django, GeoDjango, Redis, and PostGIS as our tool belt.",
