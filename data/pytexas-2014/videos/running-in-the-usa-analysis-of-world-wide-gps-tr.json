  "summary": "",
  "description": "MapMyFitness is an open fitness tracking platform that collects hundreds\nof thousands of tracks every day from GPS fitness devices around the\nplanet. Within this massive database of fitness activity lies untold\ninsights into human behavior. In this talk, I'll show how I use\nPython-based analysis tools for identifying running events, from 5ks to\nmarathons). Using a combination of Amazon Redshift SQL, scipy,\nmatplotlib & pandas, I'll show how you can glean a variety of insight\ninto running event performance, from weather and training effects on\nspeed, to regional & demographic differences in attendance.\n",
