  "description": "So you've finished your introductory course or tutorial on Python, you\nfeel good about your knowledge of the language, and you might have some\nprojects under your belt. What now? How about some of the things that\naren't really code, which nobody really teaches you in a class or\ntutorial, which can take years to learn by yourself? That's what this\ntalk is about: a few of the most common pain points for Python\nprogrammers which can easily be avoided by adopting certain tools and\npractices \"around\" the coding itself. Not coincidentally, the same tips\nmight also help improve your code and make your life with other Python\nprogrammers more harmonious. Material will roughly summarize/follow the\ncontents of http://gawp.sashahart.net, as a general and gently\nopinionated tour of common practices in the Python community.\n",
