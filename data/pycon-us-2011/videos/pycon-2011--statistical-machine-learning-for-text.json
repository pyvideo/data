  "description": "Statistical machine learning for text classification with scikit-learn\n\nPresented by Olivier Grisel\n\nThe goal of this talk is to give a state-of-the-art overview of machine\nlearning algorithms applied to text classification tasks ranging from language\nand topic detection in tweets and web pages to sentiment analysis in consumer\nproducts reviews.\n\nAbstract\n\nUnstructured or semi-structured text data is ubiquitous thanks to the read-\nwrite nature of the web. However human authors are often lazy and don't fill-\nin structured metadata forms in web applications. It is however possible to\nautomate some structured knowledge extraction with simple and scalable\nstatistical learning tools implemented in python. For instance:\n\n  * guessing the language and topic of tweets and web pages \n  * analyze the sentiment (positive or negative) in consumer products reviews in blogs or customer emails \n\nThis talk will introduce the main operational steps of supervised learning:\n\n  * extracting the relevant features from text documents \n  * selecting the right machine learning algorithm to train a model for the task at hand \n  * using the trained model on previously unseen documents \n  * evaluating the predictive accuracy of the trained model \n\nWe will also demonstrate the results obtained for above tasks using the\n[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/) package and compare it to\nother implementations such as [nltk](http://nltk.org/) and the [Google\nPrediction API](http://code.google.com/apis/predict/).\n\n",
