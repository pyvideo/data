In this tutorial we will provide a brief\nintroduction to web2py, the web based IDE, its internal design, and its\ninternal file organization. We will explain the motivations behind some of its\nmost controversial design goals. We will also discuss in some detail its Ajax\ncapabilities by using web2py components and plugins for modular design of rich\nweb interfaces.\n\nThis will be a very concentrated version (10%) of a course (CSC438) on web\nframeworks the author teaches at DePaul University. The course has been taught\n3 times and the last time counted more than 30 students.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/433_web2py-secrets-tutorial-1-2.m4v", "tags": ["pycon", "pycon2011", "web", "web2py"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivs 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Mdipierro-web2pyTutorialPycon201112623-523.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
