  "description": "An Open success for the cloud: OpenStack\n\nPresented by Andy Smith\n\nOpenStack is a collection of open source technologies written entirely in\nPython, delivering a massively scalable cloud operating system. OpenStack is\ncurrently developing two interrelated projects: OpenStack Compute and\nOpenStack Object Storage. OpenStack Compute is software to provision and\nmanage large groups of virtual private servers, and OpenStack Object Storage\nis software for creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of\ncommodity servers to store terabytes or even petabytes of data.\n\nThis talk will go into details about the success of OpenStack with Python,\nlimitations and how overall, Python was the right technology choice.\n\n",
