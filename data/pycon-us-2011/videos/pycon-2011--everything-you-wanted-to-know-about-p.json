Saunders\n\nSerializing data structures (in Python-speak \"pickling\") to save to\ndisk/socket is an important tool for the programmer: We will discuss how the\npickling protocols (0,1,2, and 3) work as well as real-world issues (gotchas,\nbackwards-compatibility, etc). We will concentrate on the basics of this\nstack-based protocol: what it looks like, how to encode/decode, speeds of\ndifferent implementations.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Pickling Protocols are a fundamental tool for saving state.\n\nWe will discuss the differences between text serialization and Python pickling\n(as well as marshalling, and simple bit-blitting).\n\nWe will spend a little time discussing history: why there is a cPickle and\npickle module in 2.x and only pickle in 3.x., and why there are 4 different\nprotocols: 0,1,2 and 3.\n\nWe will then dive right in and look at how the stack-based protocol works. We\nwill concentrate on the basics (the stack-based machine), as all the protocols\nadhere to this basic model, but tend to discuss the more recent protocols and\ntheir differences. We will also discuss how the memoization scheme works.\n\nWe will show some simple examples and then build to more complex examples.\n\nWe will also discuss the relative speeds: the different protocols (text,\n0,1,2,3) and the different implementations (Python, Boost, PicklingTools,\nIronPython?, PyPy? Unladen Swallow?).\n\nWe will end with some real-world advice and some gotchas to watch out for\n(32-bit vs. 64-bit, different versions of Python serialize differently, etc.).\n\n", "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/384_everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-pickling-but-were-afraid-to-ask.mp4", "tags": ["pickling", "pycon", "pycon2011", "serialization"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": 170182015, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2011EverythingYouWantedToKnowAboutPicklingButWere385.png", "video_flv_url": null}
