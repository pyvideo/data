  "description": "Dask is an open source, pure python library that enables parallel\nlarger-than-memory computation in a novel way. We represent programs as\nDirected Acyclic Graphs (DAG) of function calls. These graphs are\nexecuted by dask's schedulers with different optimizations (synchronous,\nthreaded, parallel, distributed-memory). Dask has modules geared towards\ndata analysis, which provide a friendly interface to building graps. One\nmodule, dask.array, mimics a subset of NumPy operations. With dask.array\nwe can work with NumPy like arrays that are larger than RAM and\nparallelization comes for free by leveraging the underlying DAG.\n",
