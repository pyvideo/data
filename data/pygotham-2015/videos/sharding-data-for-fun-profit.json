  "description": "The hash function is the veritable hammer for pounding a large array of\nengineering problems into submission. Want to shard your database? Draw\na key from your data, hash it, and voila, instant deterministic load\nbalancing! That\u2019s simple enough, until you look more carefully at\ndistributional effects, failure, and redundancy management. We\u2019ll review\nwell known (consistent hashing), not so well known (rendezvous hashing),\nand recent (shuffle sharding, copysets) work that goes a long way\ntowards engineering more favorable failure scenarios.\n",
