Recently he used manuel to do this\nsort of testing by simulating CLIs and Shell access in a doctest-style\ntest, so he may cover that as well.\n\nBring your testing challenges and the impossible to automate projects\nthat haunt you at night, we'll see what Stephan can do with them.\n\nBoston Python Meetup: May 2010\n",
