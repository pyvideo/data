  "description": "Python 101 for the .NET Developer\n\nPresented by Sarah Dutkiewicz\n\nThe first part of the session will cover the basics of Python - its history,\nhow its data structures compare to those we're familiar with in the primary\n.NET languages, its strong and weak points, who's using it, and why you as a\ndeveloper - both generally speaking and as a .NET developer - should care\nabout Python. The second part of the session will get into the demos -\nstarting with some basic Python scripts and getting into IronPython scripts,\nif time allows. By the end of this session, you'll have an idea of what Python\nis, why you should know it as a developer and specifically as a .NET\ndeveloper, and how to get setup and write a basic app in both Python and\nIronPython.\n\n",
