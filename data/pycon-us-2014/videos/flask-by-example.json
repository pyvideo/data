  "summary": "Flask is a web framework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions. It is considered a micro-framework, but don't get the \"micro\" part fool you; Flask can do everything others can do, many times in a simpler, leaner way. In this tutorial session you will follow me as I write a complete web application in front of your eyes using the core framework and a handful of extensions.",
