  "description": "Testing code with Pytest is an absolute pleasure. Less boilerplate makes your test more concise and its fixtures system helps you share setup code while still keeping your tests clear and understandable. I'll tell you all about how to get basic unit testing done, and I'll show you how to use Voidspace's Mock library to test collaborations between your objects, too.",
