  "description": "MySQL utilities are a set of command-line utilities and a Python library for making the common tasks much easier and time-saving to accomplish. The library is written entirely in Python, meaning that it is not necessary to have any other tools or libraries installed to make it work. It is currently designed to work with Python v2.6 or later and there is no support (yet) for Python v3.1.",
