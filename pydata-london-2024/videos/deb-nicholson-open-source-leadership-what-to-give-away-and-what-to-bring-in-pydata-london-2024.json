  "description": "Open Source Leadership: What to Give Away and What to Bring In\n\nMost leaders have loads of work they could give away while community-driven projects have plenty of tasks they could consider bringing in, so how do you figure out what to keep and what to give away?\n\nLeaders at large organizations are encouraged to \"give away all their legos\" also known as giving parts of your job away every few months in order to scale. Smaller open source organizations also need to grow -- but in a different way and at a different pace. Sometimes you are giving your legos away and sometimes you are moving tasks that were previously volunteer activities and bringing them into the scope of things that paid staff or contractors handle.\n\nMost leaders have loads of work they could give away and most community-driven projects have plenty of tasks they could consider bringing in, so how do you figure out which tasks belong in each category at your organization? This talk covers those decisions from the perspective of a large project with a small but growing staff. Once you've decided, you\u2019ll need a plan for effectively transitioning those responsibilities. Attendees will learn about common pitfalls and best strategies for reallocating the work of sustaining an open source project to the right place at the right time.\n\nPrior Knowledge Expected \u2013\nNo previous knowledge expected\n\n \nDeb Nicholson\nDeb Nicholson is a free software policy expert and a passionate community advocate.
