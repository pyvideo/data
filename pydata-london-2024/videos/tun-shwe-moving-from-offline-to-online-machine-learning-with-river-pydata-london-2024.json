  "description": "Moving from Offline to Online Machine Learning with River\n\nLearn how to get started on your online ML journey with River, an open source Python ML library. The foundations of machine learning were built on offline batch processing techniques for model training and inference. As organisations become more dependent on real-time data, the technological trend for machine learning in production is moving towards adding an online stream processing approach. This has benefits such as lower computational requirements due to being able to incrementally learn from a stream of data points, which enables the continual upgrading of models by adapting to real-time changes in data.\n\nThe foundations of machine learning were built on offline batch processing techniques for model training and inference. As organisations become more dependent on real-time data, the technological trend for machine learning in production is moving towards adding an online stream processing approach. This has benefits such as lower computational requirements due to being able to incrementally learn from a stream of data points, which enables the continual upgrading of models by adapting to real-time changes in data.\n\nThis has wide applications in industries such as cyber security, banking, healthcare, IIoT and any industry that involves processing large volumes of high throughput data and adapting predictive capability with real-time data feeds.\n\nThis capability was once only in the realm of Java developers but now it's available to Python developers. You\u2019ll leave this talk with an understanding of the differences between offline and online machine learning, how to complement one with the other and enough streaming concepts and best practices needed get started on your online ML journey with River, an open source Python ML library.\n\nPrior Knowledge Expected \u2013\nNo previous knowledge expected\n\n \nTun Shwe\nTun Shwe is the VP of Data at Quix, where he leads data strategy and developer relations. He is focused on helping companies imagine and implement their strategic data vision with stream processing at the forefront. He was previously a Head of Data and Data Engineer at high growth startups and has spent his career leading T-shaped teams in developing analytics platforms and data-intensive AI applications.\n\nIn his spare time, Tun goes surfing, plays guitar and tends to his analogue cameras.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
