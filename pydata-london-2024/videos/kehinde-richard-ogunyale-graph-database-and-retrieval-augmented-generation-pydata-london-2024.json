The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture represents a pivotal advancement in this domain, particularly when leveraging graph databases to augment LLMs.\nThis workshop will break down how combining these technologies can make AI not just better at creating text that's both accurate and relevant, but also capable of understanding context like never before. We'll explore the building blocks of RAG\u2014how it uses a 'retriever' to find useful information and a 'generator' to create responses. Graph databases play a crucial role here; they're a type of database that's really good at showing how different pieces of information are connected. This ability makes AI responses more insightful and adaptable to new information. Step by step, we'll walk through how to build AI applications using RAG and graph databases, covering everything from the initial setup and getting the data ready, to fine-tuning how the AI finds and uses information to answer questions or write text. This session is designed to give you the tools to create AI that not only knows more but can also use that knowledge to generate responses that truly understand and reflect the complexity of the world around us.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
