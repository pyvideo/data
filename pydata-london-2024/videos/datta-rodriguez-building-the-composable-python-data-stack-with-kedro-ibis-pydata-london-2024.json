Until recently, Python-first alternatives couldn't compete with the scale and performance of modern SQL. However, now Ibis can provide the same benefits of SQL execution with a flexible Python dataframe API, and we can leverage it to build scalable Python pipelines in Kedro. In this tutorial, we will develop a simple analytics pipeline locally, then deploy it in a cloud data warehouse, with just a configuration change.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
