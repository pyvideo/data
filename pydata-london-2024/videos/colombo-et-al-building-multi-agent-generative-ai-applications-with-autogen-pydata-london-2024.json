In this talk, we will explore the fundamentals of multi-agent systems, learn how to build applications using AutoGen, and discuss the open challenges associated with this approach, such as control trade-offs, evaluation challenges, and privacy/security considerations.\n\nWith AutoGen's open-source platform and growing ecosystem, developers can harness the power of generative AI to create advanced AI assistants and interfaces for the digital world. This talk is ideal for those with a general understanding of generative AI and Python application development.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
