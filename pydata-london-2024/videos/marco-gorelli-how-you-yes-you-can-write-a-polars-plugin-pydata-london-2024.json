It is very runtime and memory efficient and comes with a clean and expressive API. Sometimes, however, the built-in API isn't enough. And that's where its killer feature comes in: plugins. You can extend Polars, and solve practically any problem.\n\nNo prior Rust experience required, intermediate Python or general programming experience required. By the end of the session, you will know how to write your own Polars Plugin! This talk is aimed at data practitioners.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. 00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
