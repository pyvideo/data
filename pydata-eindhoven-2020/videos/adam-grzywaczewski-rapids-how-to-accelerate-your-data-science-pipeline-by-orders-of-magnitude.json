  "description": "PyData Eindhoven 2020\n\nThis talk will discuss the RAPIDS suite of open source software libraries which give you the ability to execute end-to-end data science and analytics pipelines entirely on GPUs. Because its API was deliberately designed to be consistent with existing data science utilities (e.g. Pandas DataFrame, SciKit Learn) its integration in majority of cases is limited to only several lines of code change.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. 00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
