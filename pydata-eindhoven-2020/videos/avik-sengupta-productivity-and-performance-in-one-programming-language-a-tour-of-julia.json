  "description": "PyData Eindhoven 2020\n\nThis talk answers the question: What makes Julia unique? We explore the design innovations that make Julia stand out from other languages of its generation. We discuss areas where it matters, and how it helps programmers in a wide range of domains. We will see examples of these features making a difference in real life use cases, from finance to biotech to scientific machine learning.\n\n===\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. 00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
