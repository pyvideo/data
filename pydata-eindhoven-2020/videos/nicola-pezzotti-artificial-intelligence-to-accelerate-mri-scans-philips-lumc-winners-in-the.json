  "description": "Artificial intelligence to accelerate MRI scans - Philips & LUMC winners in the fastMRI challenge\n\nPhilips succesfully participated in the first fastMRI challenge, a competition organized by NYU Langone Health and Facebook AI Resarch, to demonstrate how artificial intellignce can accelerate MRI scanners. In the talk, I will introduce the challenge and the problem, present the winning solution developed by the Philips & LUMC team and the challenge results.\n\n===\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. 00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
