  "description": "Mher Khachatryan Presents:\n\nBest Practices for Coding in ML/DS - Techniques to Construct your Project \n\nMany engineers, particularly those in Data Science, do not focus on writing better code, which their coworkers will love. This is bad!\n\nWriting cleaner code, and using appropriate tools for experiment logging reduces the time of debugging and the effort spent on the project in the long term. Consequently, the code becomes readable and onboarding new engineers on the project becomes easier.\n\nBy the end of the lecture, attendees will have learned about the importance of having a clean code in the ML project. They will have developed intuition about wiring readable and understandable code and will have acquired knowledge about the general design of a good codebase, and some tools that will help engineers log experiments for a cleaner environment.\n\nPresentation Slides: https://pydatayerevan.aua.am/files/2022/09/Mher-Khachatryan.pptx\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
