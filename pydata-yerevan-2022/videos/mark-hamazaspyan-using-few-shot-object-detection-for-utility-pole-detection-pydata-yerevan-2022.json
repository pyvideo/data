  "description": "Mark Hamazaspyan Presents:\n\nUsing Few Shot Object Detection for Utility Pole Detection from Google Street View images\n\nTraditional methods of detecting and mapping utility poles are manual, time-consuming, and costly processes. Current solutions focus on detection of T-shaped (cross-arm-shaped poles) and the lack of labeled data makes it difficult to generalize the process of other types of poles. This work aims to use Few Shot Object Detection techniques to overcome the unavailability of the data and to create a general pole detection model with few labeled images.\n\nPresentation Slides: https://pydatayerevan.aua.am/files/2022/09/Mark-Hamazaspyan.pptx\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
