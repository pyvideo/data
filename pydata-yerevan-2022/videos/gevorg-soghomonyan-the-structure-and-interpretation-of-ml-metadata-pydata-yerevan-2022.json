  "description": "Gevorg Soghomonyan Presents:\n\nThe Structure and Interpretation of ML Metadata\n\nThis talk is targeted both for ML researchers and engineers working on the ML infrastructure. The metadata generated at almost every step of the ML pipeline connects and enables the reproducible and explainable ML infrastructure. During this talk, we will go through how and where metadata is generated in ML infrastructure. The types of the metadata. What's the next generation ML infra stack to leverage the metadata and help build reproducibility, explainability, and governance into your ML systems?\n\nPresentation Slides: https://pydatayerevan.aua.am/files/2022/09/Gevorg-Soghomonyan.pdf\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
