  "description": "Anush Tosunyan Presents:\n\nTiling & Parallel Processing of Large Images \n\nDuring this session, we will review the benefits of processing large imageries by tiles, review use cases, and later combination of results. \nAs previously mentioned we will review the benefits of tile level processing for large imageries, going further into some use cases seen in data analysis, software engineering, and ML models(such as classification and segmentation). We will review how the tile data was later combined for each use case separately, and what were the benefits we saw from adopting this approach.\n\nPresentation Slides: https://pydatayerevan.aua.am/files/2022/09/Anush-Tosunyan.pdf\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
