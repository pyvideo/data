  "description": "Maria Sahakyan Presents: \n\nExplainable AI as a Conventional Data Analysis Tool\n\nThe recent surge of interest in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has spurred a wide array of models designed to make decisions in a variety of domains, including healthcare [1, 2, 3], financial systems [4, 5, 6, 7], and criminal justice [8, 9, 10], just to name a few. When evaluating alternative models, it may seem natural to prefer those that are more accurate. However, the obsession with accuracy has led to unintended consequences, as developers often strove to achieve greater accuracy at the expense of interpretability by making their models increasingly complicated and harder to understand [11]. This lack of interpretability becomes a serious concern when the model is entrusted with the power to make critical decisions that affect people\u2019s well-being. These concerns have been manifested by the European Union\u2019s recent General Data Protection Regulation, which guarantees a right to explanation, i.e., a right to understand the rationale behind an algorithmic decision that affects individuals negatively [12]. To address these issues, a number of techniques have been proposed to make the decision-making process of AI more understandable to humans. These \u201cExplainable AI \u201d techniques (commonly abbreviated as XAI) are the primary focus of this talk. \n\nThe talk will be divided into three sections, during which the audience will learn:\n\n(i) the differences between existing XAI techniques, \n(ii) the practical implementation of some well-known XAI techniques, and (iii) possible uses of XAI as a conventional data analysis tool.\n\nPresentation Slides: https://pydatayerevan.aua.am/files/2022/09/Maria-Sahakyan.pptx\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
