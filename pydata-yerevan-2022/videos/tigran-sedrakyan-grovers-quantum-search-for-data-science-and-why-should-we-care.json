  "description": "Tigran Sedrakyan Presents:\n\nGrover\u2019s Quantum Search for Data Science and Why should we Care\n\nAmong the most prominent achievements of the quantum computing field is an algorithm known as Grover\u2019s quantum search. This talk focuses on Grover\u2019s algorithm and its applications to machine learning routines. Prior knowledge required is a basic understanding of linear algebra and computer science, and familiarity with the concepts of machine learning.\n\nPresentation Slides: https://pydatayerevan.aua.am/files/2022/09/Tigran-Sedrakyan.pptx\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
