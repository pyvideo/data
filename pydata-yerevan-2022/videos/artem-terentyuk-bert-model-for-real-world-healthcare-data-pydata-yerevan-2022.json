  "description": "Artem Terentyuk Presents:\n\nBERT Model for Real World Healthcare Data\n\nEarly indication and detection of diseases, can provide patients with the chance of early intervention, better disease management, and efficient allocation of healthcare resources. The latest developments in machine learning provide a great opportunity to address this unmet need. In this lecture, we introduce modified BERT: A deep neural sequence transduction model designed for electronic health records (EHR). We will consider the application of this methodology to the task of classifying patients into cohorts reflecting different disease patterns.\n\nPresentation Slides: https://pydatayerevan.aua.am/files/2022/09/Artem-Terentyuk.pdf\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
