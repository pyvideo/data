  "description": "Nura Kawa Presents:\n\nThe Explainability Problem: Towards Understanding Artificial Intelligence \n\nThis talk discusses Explainable AI using examples of interest for both machine learning practitioners and non-technical audiences. This talk is not very technical; it does not focus on how to apply an existing method to their model. Rather, the talk discusses the problem of Explainability_ as a whole, namely: what is the Explainability Problem and why it must be solved, how recent academic literature addresses the problem, and how the problem will evolve with new legislation.\n\nPresentation Slides: https://pydatayerevan.aua.am/files/2022/09/The-Explainability-Problem_-Towards-Understanding-Artificial-Intelligence.pdf\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
