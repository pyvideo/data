  "description": "Erik Harutyunyan Presents:\n\nActive Learning for 3D Mesh Semantic Segmentation \n\nThe talk is about applications of active learning methods, mainly Monte-Carlo Dropout on 3D mesh/pointcloud semantic segmentation task. The topic is particularly interesting for practical applications of Deep Learning models on this type of data, as it gives a working approach for reducing the amount of data needed for training.\n\nI will briefly go over the 3D mesh/pointcloud semantic segmentation task, and active learning, so that it's clear for the audience not familiar with these concepts. Then I will present the PointNet++ model architecture and Monte-Carlo Dropout approach, that are specifically used in the experiments. And finally, I will share the experiment results with the audience. \n\nPresentation Slides: https://pydatayerevan.aua.am/files/2022/09/Dmitry-Korobchenko.pptx\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
