  "description": "Meirav Ben Izhak Presents:\n\nNetworkX - your Unexpected Assistant for Clustering Analysis \n\nClustering analysis is a common task in data science but it can sometimes get tedious. In this talk, I will present how functionality from the package NetworkX can assist us in analyzing and presenting the results of clustering analysis. This talk assumes no previous knowledge, a brief reminder of graph basics will be given and networkx will be shortly presented. \n\nJoin in if you:\n- want to hear about a new suggested usage of a known data structure, \n- like to get things done more efficiently when you cluster, \n- never heard of networkx but would like to,\n- all of the above.\n\nPresentation Slides: https://pydatayerevan.aua.am/files/2022/09/Meirav-Ben-Izhak.pptx\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
