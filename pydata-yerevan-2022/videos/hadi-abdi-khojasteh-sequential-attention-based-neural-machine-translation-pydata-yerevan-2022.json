  "description": "Hadi Abdi Khojasteh Presents:\n\nSequential Attention-Based Neural Machine Translation\n\nThe sequence-to-sequence models can be augmented using an attention mechanism. This algorithm will help your model understand where it should focus its attention given a sequence of inputs. This tutorial will introduce you to sequential and attention models by utilizing the neural machine translation (NMT) model implementation from scratch. Several sequence-to-sequence architectures will be presented under the attention models, including basic models, and intuitions under the attention model. We will then implement the model step by step together and see whether we can figure out the kind of model to translate (or transform) sequences of data such as texts and speech.\n\nGithub Page: https://github.com/hkhojasteh\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
