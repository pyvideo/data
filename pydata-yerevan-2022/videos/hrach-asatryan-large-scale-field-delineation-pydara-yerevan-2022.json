  "description": "Hrach Asatryan Presents:\n\nLarge Scale Field Delineation\n\nThe talk is about methods of doing large-scale field delineation from aerial imagery. Given the increasing importance of global food supplies, AI in agriculture has become integral for later development in the field. Given that modern agriculture is field level, a delineation of fields is required to be able to use such methods.\n\nPresentation Slides: https://pydatayerevan.aua.am/files/2022/09/Hrach-Asatryan.pptx\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
