  "description": "Davit Abgaryan Presents:\n\nRecommendation Systems in Market Research \n\nGathering opinion data at scale in market research assumes a platform where many users complete surveys from many different providers. As a result, the problem of matching surveys with users arises. Taking into account specifics of the market research industry, recommendation systems, multicriteria optimization, and regression models become a crucial part of efficient user-survey matching at scale.\n\nPresentation Slides: https://pydatayerevan.aua.am/files/2022/09/Davit-Abgaryan.pdf\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
