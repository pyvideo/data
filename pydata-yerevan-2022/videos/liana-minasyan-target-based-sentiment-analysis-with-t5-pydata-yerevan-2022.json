  "description": "Liana Minasyan Presents:\n\nTarget-Based Sentiment Analysis with T5\n\nThe classic sentiment analysis analyzes texts, images, emojis, etc to know what other people think of a product, service, company, or event. While sentiment analysis can be considered one of the accomplished tasks of Natural Language Processing tasks, more fine-grained types of it like Target Based Sentiment Analysis(TSA) or Aspect-based sentiment analysis(ABSA) are not quite the same. In TSA we want to see the sentiment of a given text towards a particular entity(in my case person or organization). This task is one of the non-solved ones. With the T5 question answering transformer model it was possible to solve the task with results 20% higher than the current leaderboards.\n\nPresentation Slides: https://pydatayerevan.aua.am/files/2022/09/Liana-Minasyan.pptx\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
