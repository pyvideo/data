  "description": "Katherine Munro Presents: \n\nEating humble Py: From toy problem to real-world solution in predicting Customer Lifetime Value\n\nThis is the story of my team\u2019s journey from play-problem to real-world solution. Learn, as we learned, what is Customer Lifetime Value and why does everyone in retail suddenly want to predict it? Take a tour of common approaches to solving this problem, from machine learning to good old-fashioned spreadsheets. Feel all the practical pains our clients inflicted on us, and discover why CLV prediction is not as easy as Towards Data Science makes it out to be.\n\nWhether you\u2019re an analytics enthusiast, a novice data scientist or an experienced practitioner, and whether you work in retail or not, there\u2019s something in this talk for you: a little bit of machine learning theory, a peek into a new domain of application you may not be familiar with, or the chance to just cringe in sympathy at problems you know only too well.\n\nPresentation Slides: https://pydatayerevan.aua.am/files/2022/09/Katherine-Munro-.pptx\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
