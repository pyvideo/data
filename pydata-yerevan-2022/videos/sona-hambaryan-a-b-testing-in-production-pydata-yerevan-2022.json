  "description": "Sona Hambaryan Presents:\n\nA/B Testing in Production\n\nBeing part of statistical learning apparatus, and having a strong mathematical background AB testing remains one of the aspects in the field that continue to be violated and misinterpreted. A big part of violations covers the wrong experiment setup, which I'll try to cover in practice taking into consideration the business setup: whether it's a B2B platform or B2C.\n\nThe main takeaway from this talk will be to understand the pitfalls that relay under experiment setup, where a single disregarded use case can violate the whole experiment outcome. \n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
