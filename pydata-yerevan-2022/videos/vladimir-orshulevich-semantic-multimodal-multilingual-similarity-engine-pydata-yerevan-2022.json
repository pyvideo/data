  "description": "Vladimir Orshulevich Presents:\n\nSemantic Multimodal Multilingual Similarity Engine\n\nSince multimodality became popular, lots of engineers are trying to make a domain-universal search. The search engines that will find in images by textual query, HTML file by piece of audio, and so on. So here is our (Unum) approach with a bias toward GPU accelerating inference (for underlying models) and a passion to distribute everything.\n\nDuring the presentation, we will discuss the following questions:\n\n-How to build fast and precise Semantic Textual Similarity engine. \n-Multilingual sentence encoders. \n-What is CLIP and how can we find an image with a textual query. \n-Building indices: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Algorithms and toolkits. \n-What is the future of the semantic cross-domain search.\n\nPresentation Slides: https://pydatayerevan.aua.am/files/2022/09/Vladimir-Orshulevich.pdf\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
