  "description": "Alex Laptev Presents:\n\nNVIDIA NeMo: Toolkit for Conversational AI \n\nConversational AI is a technology that allows a \u201cmachine\u201d to speak to a person in a natural language. NVIDIA NeMo is an open-source conversational AI toolkit built for researchers working on automatic speech recognition (ASR), natural language processing (NLP), and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS). The primary objective of NeMo is to help researchers from industry and academia to develop new models for automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech, natural language processing, and neural machine translation. Nemo also has a large number of step-by-step tutorials and pre-trained models.\n\nThe outline of the talk goes as follows:\n1. NeMo overview.\n2. Where to start: tutorials on ASR, TTS, and NLP.\n3. NeMo ASR overview.\n4. NeMo TTS overview.\n5. NeMo NLP overview.\n6. From research to production: deploying NeMo models.\n\nPresentation Slides: https://pydatayerevan.aua.am/files/2022/09/Alex-Laptev.pptx\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
