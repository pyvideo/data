  "description": "Rudolf Eremyan Presents:\n\nBuilding Data Pipelines on AWS\n\nBuilding Data Pipelines on AWS and hidden costs that can destroy budget\u2024\nData is the new fuel. The majority of modern IT companies make their decision based on collected data. An important role during this process plays the data engineering side which is responsible for delivering data in the needed format. During the speech, I want to talk about ways to create Data Pipelines on Amazon Web Services. Except for data engineering, I want to focus attention on the hidden costs that can easily destroy project's budget.\n\nPresentation Slides: https://pydatayerevan.aua.am/files/2022/09/Rudolf-Eremyan.pptx\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
