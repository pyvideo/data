  "description": "Viacheslav Inozemtsev Presents:\n\nBuilding a Lakehouse data platform using Delta Lake, PySpark, and Trino\n\nIn this talk I would like to present the concept of Lakehouse, which is a novel architecture to resolve problems and combine capabilities of the classical Data Warehouse and Data Lake. I will talk about the Delta Lake table format that resides in the core of Lakehouse. I will demonstrate how Delta Lake integrates with Apache Spark, to build data ingestion pipelines. I will also show how Delta Lake integrates with Apache Trino, to provide a fast SQL-based serving layer. As a result, I will bring all these components together to describe how they enable a modern big data platform. \n\nPresentation Slides: https://pydatayerevan.aua.am/files/2022/09/Viacheslav-Inozemtsev.pdf\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
