  "description": "Ricardas Ralys Presents:\n\nUsing Python for the PCR Design or an Easy Way to Data Analysis in Life Science Projects\n\nThe development of life science projects is often based on Python, as these projects have to do with data analysis and optimization problems -- the language is widespread, universal, and expressive.\nIn one of our projects, we worked on a solution for a widely spread reaction used in health care -- PCR and, consequently, data analysis.\nThis can be easily realized using Python libraries like NumPy. The engineers used NumPy to build graphs based on the sequences\u2019 statistics efficiently.\n\nDuring my talk, I\u2019ll share the benefits of using Python we got, why we need the Steiner tree problem, and why optimizing graphs is the key to solving the optimization problem we had at hand.\n\nQuantori works at the intersection of IT, biology, chemistry, medicine, and other fields of studies to create solutions that maintain and improve people\u2019s health and life quality. So, it is essential to find the optimal algorithms and solutions to complex projects, work out efficient processes, and ensure the products\u2019 high standards.\n\nPresentation Slides: https://pydatayerevan.aua.am/files/2022/09/Ricardas-Ralys.pptx\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
