  "description": "Hadi Abdi Khojasteh Presents:\n\nLarge Scale Representation Learning In-the-wild\n\nA significant amount of progress is being made today in the field of representation learning. It has been demonstrated that unsupervised techniques can perform as well as, if not better than, fully supervised ones on benchmarks such as image classification, while also demonstrating improvements in label efficiency by multiple orders of magnitude. In this sense, representation learning is now addressing some of the major challenges in deep learning today. It is imperative, however, to understand systematically the nature of the learnt representations and how they relate to the learning objectives.\n\nIn this talk, we will present a comprehensive overview of representation learning from the beginning to the modern models, contextualize these methods, and discuss the pros and cons of current evaluation methods. New era of deep learning methods that could understand simultaneously the different variety of data will introduce by its evolutions.\n\nPresentation Slides: https://pydatayerevan.aua.am/files/2022/09/Representation-Learning-Presentation.pdf\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
