  "description": "Zohreh Jafari Presents:\n\nBuilding a Streaming (E-health) Data Pipeline: When and How?\n\nIn this talk, we discuss streaming and the real-time data stack as a solution for analyzing massive, unbounded data sets that are increasingly common in many modern businesses in different fields and their need for more timely and accurate answers.\n\nA streaming data pipeline flows data continuously from source to destination as it is generated, making it being processed along the way so they are used when the analytics, application, or business process requires an updating data flow for an on-time analysis. This analysis can be descriptive like a data dashboard, diagnostic like monitoring logs, predictive like an online fraud detection system, or prescriptive like data process in self-driving cars.\n\nDuring the talk, examples of e-health data pipelines plus our experience in setting up a data streaming stack help to explicitly of the subject.\n\nPresentation Slides: https://pydatayerevan.aua.am/files/2022/09/Zohreh-Jafari.pdf\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
