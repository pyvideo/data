  "description": "Hovhannes Margaryan Presents:\n\nClassical Texture Synthesis and Beyond \n\nGiven the structural definition of a texture as a special variation in diverse layers of pixels demonstrating reiterating patterns combined with varied randomness in quantity, the purpose of texture synthesis is to generate an expanded vision of the input texture that perceptually resembles the input. The goal of the talk is to provide an overview of classical and neural texture synthesis algorithms. First, two classical non-parametric methods namely Texture Optimization for Example-based Synthesis and Image Quilting for Texture Synthesis and Transfer are covered. Second, two neural methods of texture synthesis are discussed: Texture Synthesis using CNNs and Non-Stationary Texture Synthesis by Adversarial Expansion. Third, the advantages and disadvantages of these four methods are demonstrated. Results of the indicated four approaches and a visual comparison are provided.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
