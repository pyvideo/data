  "description": "DjangoCon US 2016 - WebSockets: Intro to Messaging by Josue Balandrano Coronel\n\nToday\u2019s web applications demand information to be delivered immediately after it is available. This is a huge step from where everything started, simple HTTP blocking requests. In order to solve this Server Side Events (SSE) and Websockets (WS) were created. SSE works from the server to the client only and it uses the HTTP protocol. WS is bidirectional and implements a layer on top of HTTP. WS started to get more momentum and now most of modern web browsers support it.",
