  "description": "Josh Simmons\nhttps://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/36/view_talk\nWhat makes new developers choose Django over Rails or WordPress? As a web developer and community organizer, Josh has learned a lot about the differences between the frameworks and why people make the choices they do.\n\nWe'll compare Django with other ecosystems to see where it excels and where it lags. You'll leave with a better sense of the web ecosystem as a whole and why people are choosing things that *aren't* Django. Critically, attendees will leave with specific ideas about how to attract more new developers.",
