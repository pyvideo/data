What happens at startup before your code is run? How is your code translated to VM bytecode, what does that bytecode mean, and how is it run? In this talk, we'll dive into all of those fun parts!\n\nThis will help you understand what your code is doing under the hood, how to potentially optimize it, and to know the advantages and disadvantages of CPython and how they affect you.",
