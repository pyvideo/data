  "description": "Tom Eastman\nhttps://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/148/view_talk\nEvery web application has an attack surface -- the exposed points of interaction where a malicious or mischievous user can commit malice, or mischief (respectively). Possibly nowhere, however, is more vulnerable than places a user is allowed to upload arbitrary files.\n\nThe scope for abuse is eye-widening: The contents of the file, the type of the file, the size and encoding of the file, even the *name* of the file can be a potent vector for attacking your system.\n\nThe scariest part? Even the best and most secure web-frameworks (yes, I'm talking about Django) can't protect you from all of it.\n\nIn this talk, I'll show you every scary thing I know about that can be done with a file upload, and how to protect yourself from -- hopefully -- most of them.",
