  "description": "Eloise Macdonald-Meyer\nhttps://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/179/view_talk\nThis talk will explore the various mental health pressures and impacts that development can have, as well as the strategies developers, and their workplaces, can use to deal with them to support those who may be suffering.\nMany conversations have been started about mental health in technology, and it is important for these to continue. Parts of the development process can sometimes lead to situations where looking after yourself can be difficult and it is important not only to be able to minimise the risk of these, but to be able to recognise them and find ways out of them.\nOn the other hand, the amount of technology to help combat mental health is increasing, and what better demographic to test, use and further develop these technologies than developers themselves. This talk will also discuss the rise and continuity of technology to assist in mental health.",
