  "description": "OpenBMC is an open source software project that replaces the Baseboard Management Controller firmware that is responsible for turning off and on, and managing the health of your server. The core of the software that performs these functions is implemented in Python, allowing easy to read, modify and debug firmware that is traditionally not accessible to a user. This talk will cover the architecture of the OpenBMC and demonstrate how easy it is to support a new server platform by writing a few lines of Python.",
