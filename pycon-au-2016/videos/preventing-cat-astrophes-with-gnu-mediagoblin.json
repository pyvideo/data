It would be a cat-atstrophe!\n\nGNU MediaGoblin is Python-based media publishing system for artists \u2014 an alternative to centralised, censored and surveilled systems like Flickr, YouTube and SoundCloud. MediaGoblin gives people privacy, choice and control of their own media, something we need now more than ever.\n\nThis talk will explore the architecture of GNU MediaGoblin, the technical challenges in implementing fully decentralised sharing and commenting through PyPump and the Pump.io API as well as work to lower the Python deployment barrier to empower normal people to escape the centralised systems (\"userops\").",
