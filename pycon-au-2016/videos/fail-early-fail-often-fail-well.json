Your client and you can\u2019t see eye to eye, or your enthusiastic new business partner has dropped off the radar. The project you\u2019ve invested weeks, months, or years into may never see the light of day.\n\nFailure comes in many forms and the increasing complexity of our projects and the world they operate in doesn\u2019t help. Despite our best efforts, learning the hard way is often the only way. Perhaps this is why modern startup culture has rallied around the mantra: \u201cFail fast. Fail early. Fail often.\u201d But I spent the better part of my career failing in freelance, agency, and startups, and the experience leads me to believe the common refrain to be lacking.\n\nLike gymnasts who train to fall properly, I believe we must learn to fail well. In this talk, I draw from my experience learning the hard way, flagging the ten easiest and most insidious mistakes one can make. Because failure is inevitable, I will also be sharing a framework for recovery that includes managing yourself, your relationships, and your reputation.\n\nAttendees will leave with a better sense of what NOT to do, an idea of how to cope with failure, and the knowledge that failure is inevitable and that\u2019s OK.",
