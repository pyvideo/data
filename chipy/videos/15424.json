  "description": "This talk explores a new framework for building Artificial Intelligence (AI) inspired by the human brain and leveraging the power of Python. We'll delve into the concept of consciousness as a combination of memory, prediction, and experience. By using hierarchical probabilities, similar to Google's PageRank algorithm, we can build AI systems that are not only powerful but also understandable and aligned with human values. Python will be our toolset as we explore the exciting future of AI development.",
