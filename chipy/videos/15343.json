  "description": "Presenting on an open source project I started and have\u00a0been working on since three years ago. It is a library named PyPDFForm which has a variety of utilities making processing PDF forms easier with Python. I'll discuss what\u00a0sparked\u00a0this idea, give a little coding session to demo some of the library's\u00a0functionalities, and talk about the future of the library.\r\n\r\nHere is a brief layout of what I'm currently planning on for the speak.\r\n\r\n* First 15 minutes: Intro. Some background, both personal and about the library. What sparked\u00a0this idea and just general motivations.\r\n\r\n* Next 10 minutes: A coding session which demos some basic but essence functionalities of the library.\r\n\r\n* Final 5 minutes: Talk about the future of the library. What are some restrictions it has now. What are some improvements that can be done. And QA.\r\n\r\nSome PyPDFForm links:\r\n\r\nGitHub:\u00a0https://github.com/chinapandaman/PyPDFForm\r\n\r\nPyPi:\u00a0https://pypi.org/project/PyPDFForm/",
