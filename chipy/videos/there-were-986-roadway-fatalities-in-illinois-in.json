  "summary": "Seen on garish LED roadway signs all around Chicago on New Year's Eve,\n2013: 986 TRAFFIC DEATHS IN 2013. It leads to many questions: On what\nroads? When did the accidents happen? What do we do now? I'm scared to\ndrive. I will talk about purging my fears by finding the data to answer\nsome of those questions. http://tothebeat.github.io/fatal-car-crashes/\nThis talk will involve PythonAnywhere, IPython, a module that's not even\non PyPi (dbfpy), searching for and finding open government data,\nCartoDB, Google Fusion Tables, csv, and maybe Pandas. Rest assured,\nthere will be no graphic photos.\n",
