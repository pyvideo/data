    "title": "PyScript for data science",
    "description": "Are you a data scientist or a developer who mostly uses Python? Are you jealous of developers who write Javascript code and build fancy websites in a browser? How nice would it be if we can write websites in Python? PyScript makes it possible! PyScript allows users to write Python in the browser. In this talk, I will introduce PyScript and discuss what does PyScript mean for data scientists, how PyScript might change the way data scientists work, and how PyScript can be incorporated into the data science workflow.",
