    "description": "Web engineers meet issues with performance with fast-growing or even maintaining existing products. It\u2019s always unexpected and we have limited time for decisions. With our hero, we meet real-faced RAM, CPU and IO problems and learn troubleshooting approaches to monolithic and distributed systems.\n\nWe try different existing tools from Python and the cloud ecosystem including, but not limited to: cProfile, yappi, memory-profiler and tracing.\n\nThis talk will be more focused on backend parts and designed for intermediate-level web engineers, but all skill levels are welcome.",
