    "description": "Python has many excellent back-end frameworks, but we can't use it yet for mainstream front-end development. How do we bring our web pages to life without having to write Javascript, and without learning a front end framework like React or AngularJS?\n\nThe htmx library uses simple tag attributes to add behaviour to HTML tags. It gives you access to AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets and Server Sent Events directly in HTML for modern user interfaces.\n\nLearn how, without refreshing the page, you can: create, update and delete data; change the date range for a chart; drill down using a sequence of dropdowns; and create an interactive search box.\n\nDiscover how to use htmx with any Python web framework. The examples will mostly use Django, plus a single example of how to use the same ideas in Flask.\n\nYou will also see how to create an infinite scrolling page, a sortable drag and drop table, and more.",
