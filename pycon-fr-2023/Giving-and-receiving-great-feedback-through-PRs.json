    "description": "Do you struggle with PRs? Have you ever had to change code even though you disagreed with the change just to land the PR? Have you ever given feedback that would have improved the code only to get into a comment war? We'll discuss how to give and receive feedback to extract maximum value from it and avoid all the communication problems that come with PRs. We'll start with some thoughts about what PRs are intended to achieve and then first discuss how to give feedback that will be well received and result in improvements to the code followed by how to extract maximum value from feedback you receive without agreeing to suboptimal changes. Finally, we will look at a checklist for giving and receiving feedback you can use as you go through reviews both as an author and reviewer.",
