    "description": "pip install malware: it\u2019s that easy. Almost all projects depend on external packages, but did you know how easy it can be to install something nasty instead of the dependency you want? I'll be showing this live, as I make malware and infect my own computer with it during the talk!\n\nYou might remember classic typosquatting examples like goggle.com, but it\u2019s now common to see malicious code hidden in spoofed or otherwise fraudulent PyPI packages or nested dependencies. Malware developers can also use techniques like starjacking to appear legitimate, so these unpleasant packages become even more difficult to spot. It\u2019s estimated that over 3% of packages on PyPI could be using this technique.\n\nBy the end of this talk, you\u2019ll know how to protect yourself when installing and updating dependencies and you\u2019ll leave with a checklist to follow to help you stay safe in future.",
