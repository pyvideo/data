  "summary": "Celery is great for asynchronously sending emails from your web app. But\nwhat happens when you grow beyond simple \"set it and forget it\" tasks?\nThis talk explores Celery's workflow primitives and how to create\ncomplex distributed applications. It assumes knowledge of Python and\nCelery. By the end, you will better understand how to structure\ndistributed work that robustly scales.\n",
