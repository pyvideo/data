  "description": "Have you ever considered how many relationships you have in your\nvirtual life? Every friend or page liked on Facebook, each connection\nin LinkedIn or Twitter account followed is a new relationship not\nonly between two people, but also between their data. In Brazil only,\nwe have 160 millions Facebook users. How can we represent and\nmanipulate all these relationships? Graph Databases are storage\nsystems that use graph structure (nodes and edges) to represent and\nstore data in a semantic way.\n\nThis talk will begin approaching the challenge in representing\nrelationships in Relational Databases and introducing a more friendly\nsolution using graph. The definition of Graph Database, its pros and\ncons and some available tools (Neo4J, OrientDB and TitanDB) will be\nshown during the presentation, as well as how these tools can be\nintegrated with Python.\n\nOutline:\n\n\nRelationships\n\n- Relationships in Relational Databases\n- Graph Definition\n- Graph approach to represent relationships\n\nGraph Databases\n\n- Definition\n- Advantages\n\nNeo4J\n\n- Usage Examples\n- Integration with Python\n\nComparison between Graph Databases\n\n- Comparison between Neo4J and Relational Database\n- Applications",
