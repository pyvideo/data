  Declarative Programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on
  describing what should be computed in a problem domain without
  describing how it should be done.  The talk starts by explaining
  differences between a declarative and imperative approach with the
  help of examples from everyday life. Having established a clear
  notion of declarative programming as well as pointed out some
  advantages, we transfer these concepts to programming in general. For
  example, the usage of control flow statements like loops
  over-determine the order of computation which impedes scalable
  execution as well as it often violates the single level of
  abstraction principle.

  Following the theoretical part of the talk, some practical examples
  are given how declarative programming can be applied easily within
  Python. This comprises the advantages and disadvantages of using a
  configuration file, e.g. config.yaml, versus a Python configuration
  module, e.g. setup.py. Furthermore, the benefits of avoiding
  statements of control flow with the help of list and dictionary
  comprehensions as well as sets are demonstrated.

  The talk is concluded by a short, high-level excursion to a logistic
  programming language, namely PyDatalog in order to build the bridge
  between logistic and declarative programming. This is accomplished by
  showing how a mathematical crossword can be easily solved with the
  help of declarative and logistic programming.
