  "description": "\"To put an accessible and affordable health service in the hands of every person on earth.\"\n\nThats our mission at babylon. Leveraging the powers of AI, python and\nmicro services we took a step towards that vision by building a\nmedical chatbot that we shipped in November last year. In this talk I\nwould like to share with you all the things we learnt in the process.\n\nThis talk is our story. Its a story that starts with an idea and\nmeanders through the dark and dangerous land of things like Graph\ndatabases, machine learning and async programming in python. The\nstory is far from over, but we have come to a point where we would\nlike to reflect and share with the community all that we have learnt.\n\nMore specifically I will cover:\n\n- Architecture decisions we made and why we made them\n- lessons learnt doing async in python at scale\n- testing chatbots\n- clinical governance and safety (literally 2 sentences, I promise)\n- The drawbacks of REST\n- Why I am glad we did most of it in Python\n\nAnd then of course some time for questions at the end :)",
