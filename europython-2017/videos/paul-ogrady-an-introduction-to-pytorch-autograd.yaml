  PyTorch is an optimized tensor library for Deep Learning, and is a
  recent newcomer to the growing list of GPU programming frameworks
  available in Python. Like other frameworks it offers efficient tensor
  representations and is agnostic to the underlying hardware. However,
  unlike other frameworks it allows you to create ""define-by-run""
  neural networks resulting in dynamic computation graphs, where every
  single iteration can be different---opening up a whole new world of
  possibilities. Central to all neural networks in PyTorch is the
  Autograd package, which performs Algorithmic Differentiation on the
  defined model and generates the required gradients at each iteration.
  In this talk I will present a gentle introduction to the PyTorch
  library and overview its main features using some simple examples,
  paying particular attention to the mechanics of the Autograd package.

  Keywords: GPU Processing, Algorithmic Differentiation, Deep Learning, Linear algebra.
