  "description": "Our mission is to manage a huge amount of communication and document\ndata in large scale industry projects by providing web based project\nmanagement systems. The increasing amount of communication creates\nthe desire for a GPS helping us and our customers to navigate through\nthe communication stream. Our R&D projects are focusing on topics\nlike clustering, event detection, and network analysis (Who knows\nwho, domain experts).\n\nTraveling the wild side of NLP, Data Science, and Analytics, we\nstumbled across amazing Python tools supporting us in our goal to\nnavigate the project communication and therefor supporting our\nclients in Project & Risk Management avoiding wrong turns. We\nwould like to share some of our approaches to answer our research\ntopics and challenges:\n\nOne of the challenges, amongst others, is to utilize and adapt up to\ndate clustering algorithms for social stream data and to expose them\nas reentrant services. Another one is to tailor them for the current\napplication domain, improving clustering precision by parametrization\nand other means. Furthermore the integration of a Python based\nanalytics system into an existing JAVA based application environment\nand eco system is required.\n\nIn addition, we would also like to share some of our \"traffic jams\"\nexperienced during our travel starting as traditional Java/SQL\nfocusing company that integrated Python into its development\nportfolio.",
