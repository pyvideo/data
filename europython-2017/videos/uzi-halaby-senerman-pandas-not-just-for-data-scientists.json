  "description": "This is not a tutorial. It's an attempt to expose non data scientists\nexperienced pythonistas to the powerful pandas library. Most of\npython developers don't use pandas (either because they never heard\nof it, felt that it's a too steep learning curve or never thought\nthat it will be useful for them). I intend to talk about python\nperformance limitations and show how pandas can be used to overcome\nsome of these limitations. The talk will be accompanied by a live\nJupiter Notebook session that will demonstrate a typical use of\npandas.",
