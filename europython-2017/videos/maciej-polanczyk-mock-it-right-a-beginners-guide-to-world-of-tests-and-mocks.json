  "description": "The main goal of this presentation is to make beginner audience\nfamiliar with mocks and patches but there is a chance that more\nexperienced ones will also find something new for themselves.\nPresentation shows the common use cases when developing unit tests. I\nwill say what are the best practices when working with mocks and\npatches and what kind of mistakes, done by many developers, may be\navoided so the dragons will not come. During this presentation I will\nprepare mock-it-o drink as a prize.\n\nFirst, I will briefly introduce an audience with the topic of unit\ntesting. Then I will show a simple code which will be tested during\nthe presentation. It covers all common use cases of writing unit\ntests which are usage of mocks, patches and their side effects. In\nthe end I will show a template of unit test which will be extended\naccording to our needs.\n\nNext, I will say what is a mock, and what are the benefits of using\nit. Why it is better than any Dummy class implemented for purpose of\nunit tests and, what is the most important and sometimes forgotten by\nexperienced developers, how to create the best mock, which involves\nusing spec_set and spec to protect us from dragons when interface of\nmocked class changes.\n\nLast but not least part of my presentation will be dedicated to\npatches. I will explain when and how patches should be used (how to\nuse side_effect, patch properties and environment variables).\nFinally, I will say how to avoid common mistakes when working with\npatches.",
