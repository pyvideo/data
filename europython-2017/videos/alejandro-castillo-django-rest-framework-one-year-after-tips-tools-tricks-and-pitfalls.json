  "description": "One year ago we started OnTruck. Our CTO had previously had some success\nwith DRF so after discussing it, we decided to give it a try.\nAfter a year building a quickly iterating startup on top of Django Rest Framework,\nwe have reflected a lot on it. Even now, with a full year of development\non top of it, we still periodically discuss going forward or dropping it.\nFor the time being it still wins. So we think we have learned a lot about it.\n\nThis talk is a walkthrough of the discoveries & learnings we have made\nat OnTruck during that year.\nWe will cover different aspects of the framework, what advantages\nit has given us and also what tradeoffs it has forced.\n\nWe will discuss both how it relates to Django on the inside and how it\nrelates with other systems outside. We will approach it both from\na purely user perspective and also discuss some of its internals\nand the way we tweaked them to make it work for us.\n\nWe will cover the pitfalls we have both avoided and fallen into.\nThe tricks that have helped us keep our speed and sanity.\nThe tools we have both used and discarded on the way.\n\nAnd finally the tips we would give ourselves if we were starting all\nover again after this year.",
