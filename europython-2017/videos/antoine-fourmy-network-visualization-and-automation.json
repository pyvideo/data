  "description": "Network automation and orchestration is the latest phase in the evolution\nof IP and optical networks.\nOver the last few years, network engineers have created a variety of\nlibraries and softwares to help them with the management, configuration and automation of huge networks made of hundreds of thousands of network devices (e.g. routers, switches, antenna...).\n\nIn this talk, I will introduce NetDim, a vendor-neutral software\nfor network modeling and automation based on the standard Python\nlibrary for GUI programming: tkinter.\n\nI will start the presentation with an introduction to network visualization,\nand show how tkinter can be used to implement graph drawing algorithms,\nas well as a full-on Geographic Information System (GIS),\nallowing one to place network devices on a world map at their GPS coordinates.\n\nI will then discuss the whys and wherefores of network automation,\nand show how to automatically generate and push scripts to a network\ndevice via SSH or Telnet.\n\nMore details about NetDim on github https://github.com/mintoo/NetDim and\non this website http://netdim.fr",
