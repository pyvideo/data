You will get an idea of what pitfalls you have to face\nwhen working with something as fast changing as Instagram and how to\nbest tackle this.\n\nYou'll  learn what the \"Page Object\" design pattern is, what it is\nuseful for and why we use it.\n\nOf course we will also talk about OpenSource and why it's important.\n\nA lot of the talk will be based on my article on InstaPy published at\nthe freeCodeCamp publication on Medium:\nhttps://medium.freecodecamp.com/my-open-source-instagram-bot-got-me-2-500-real-followers-for-5-in-server-costs-e40491358340\n\nSo, who is this talk suited for?\n\nIf you're just starting out with python, are interested in automation\nor simply like to see a fun and interesting little open source\nproject, I'd love to see you at my talk and hear your ideas and\nopinions about it.",
