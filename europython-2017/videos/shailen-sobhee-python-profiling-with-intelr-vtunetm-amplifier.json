  "description": "Python has grown in both significance and popularity in the last\nyears, especially in the field of high performance computing and\nmachine learning. When it comes to performance, there are numerous\nways of profiling and measuring code performance\u2014with each analysis\ntool having its own strengths and weaknesses. In this talk, we will\nintroduce a rich GUI application (Intel\u00ae VTune\u2122 Amplifier) which can\nbe used to analyze the runtime performance of one\u2019s Python\napplication, and fully understand where the performance bottlenecks\nare in one\u2019s code.  With this application, one may also analyze the\ncall-stacks and get quick visual clues where one\u2019s Python application\nis spending time or wasting CPU cycles.",
