  "description": "Simple is better than complex, right? That\u2019s true for data pipelines too.\n\nFor more than 5 years, I hacked together extract-transform-load (ETL)\nprocesses in various different positions (ETL is just a fancy term\nfor \u00abbunch of things that take data somewhere and put it elsewhere,\neventually transformed\u00bb).\n\nI did it as a founder, as a consultant, as a technical co-founder,\nfor some side projects, and now in a big corp (to be continued\u2026).\n\nIn each case, I felt frustrated with the tools available, and in some\nserious cases, I had to hack things myself to get the job done.\n\nhttps://www.bonobo-project.org/\n\nBonobo is the repackaging of my past experiences for python 3.5+, and\ngrasping the basics should not take more than the length of the\npresentation.\n\nTopics outline (subject to small changes) :\n\n- INTRO : State of the art / different tools for different needs.\n- Where does it come from.\n- Writing a data processor.\n- Running and monitoring data jobs.\n- OUTRO : The road ahead.\n- Q&A\n\nBonobo is the glue you need to tie together regular functions in a\ntransformation graph (think unix pipes). Execution strategies are\nabstracted so you can focus on the real operations. As a result, you\ncan engineer simple and testable systems, using the same good\ncomputer development practices as you use in -insert your favorite\nfield here-.\n\nSpoiler : there is no \u00abbig data\u00bb in this talk.",
