  "description": "We will program some ESP8266-based development boards, make them\nblink LEDs, move servos, display pictures, read sensors, react to\nbuttons, and, more importantly, talk over HTTP and MQTT with servers.\nThis is an excellent occasion to try your skills in building and\nprogramming small electronic devices. No experience with electronics\nis required, everything you need to know will be covered during the\nworkshop.\n\nYou will need to bring a laptop with a USB port. If it runs Windows,\nmake sure to have some terminal emulator installed, such as PuTTy,\nCoolTerm or  even HyperTerm. On Linux and OSX we will use Screen, so\nyou don't need anything special.\n\nI only have about 20 kits for this, so the number of people that can\ntake part is limited.",
