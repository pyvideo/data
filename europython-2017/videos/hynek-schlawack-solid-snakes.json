  "description": "No matter whether you run a web app, search for gravitational waves,\nor maintain a backup script: being responsible for a piece of\nsoftware or infrastructure means that you either get a pager right\naway, or that you get angry calls from people affected by outages.\nBeing paged at 4am in everyday life is bad enough. Having to fix\nproblems from hotel rooms while your travel buddies go for brunch is\neven worse.\n\nAnd while incidents can\u2019t be prevented completely, there are ways to\nmake your systems more reliable and minimize the need for (your!)\nmanual intervention. This talk will help you to get calm nights and\nrelaxing vacations by teaching you some of them.",
