  Web-developers use Python to develop web-applications, serving HTML
  or JSON content to user's browsers which render it. We test our
  applications to check that they serve content right and that they
  respond to HTTP requests in an expected way. However, this is not all
  that happens in a modern web application. There are lots of moving
  parts which are executed not on the server, but directly in user's
  browser, and they need to be tested too. The best way to check that
  our app works well in a browser is to test it in a browser, and
  Python gives you tools to do that conveniently.

  With a Selenium tool and Python package, you can control the
  browsers, making them open web pages and interacting with them. I
  will show how to install Selenium and needed drivers, and tell about
  best practices for writing Selenium tests, such as

  - Page Object pattern
  - Put browser interactions in the page object, not the test
  - Put assertions in the test, not the page object
  - Never use time.sleep()
  - Always make pages wait for actions to complete
  - Wait for JavaScript to load

  To test the visual look of your application there is a Needle tool,
  which lets you compare screenshots with baseline set, and highlight
  the differences. I will talk about how to incorporate that
  functionality into your tests.

  As browser testing can get quite slow, I will also show how to set up
  running them concurrently.
