  "description": "A discussion about making full-featured, commercial games in python,\nboth 2D and 3D.\n\nLooking at state of the art approaches to using python in gaming, we\nwill compare the alternatives: pygame (2D API), OpenGL (via\npygame/pySDL2), Unreal Engine 4 and the Godot Engine (with further\ncomparison to Unity 3D game engine).\n\nWe will also look at other benefits of using python in the gaming\ncontext, such as integration with 3D modelling software, scripting\nthe asset pipeline and GIS data integration.\n\nFinally, can (and should) python move beyond being the language of\nplugins and scripts, and become the main language for creating game\ndevelopment projects?",
