  "description": "You think, all that hype about streaming solutions does not affect\nyou? I thought so also. But when playing around with that topic for\nsome time, I realized that it sheds a different light on many topics\nI struggled with for some time. In this talk I want to share with you\nwhat I discovered when switching from a from a database centric view\nto stream oriented processing.\n\nSplitting your application in smaller services gets easier as you\nhave more natural boundaries. You have more options to run different\ndata schema versions in different services (instead of one central db\nupgrade). More scaling possibilities. Operations improvements.\n\nFor sure, streaming does not solve any problem, but much more than I\nthought before. And in python you have good support with many\nstreaming clients. I will give some examples and comparisons for\nworking with Kafka and Avro Schemas.",
