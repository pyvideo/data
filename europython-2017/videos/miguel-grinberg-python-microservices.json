  "description": "This talk is for Python web developers interested in learning what\nare the core ideas behind microservices, what problems they try to\nsolve, and what are the viable options to implement them in Python,\nboth from technical and teamwork point of views. Some of the topics\nthat will be discussed include the role of APIs, the improvements\nmicroservices bring to application scalability, upgrades, and\nmaintenance, and the challenges in breaking up a monolithic\napplication.\n\nAttendees will leave the talk with a good idea of what microservices\nare, and how they help build better applications. As usual with my\npresentations, there will be actual code examples presented during\nthe talk that I will also host on GitHub, for those interested in\ninvestigating further on their own.",
