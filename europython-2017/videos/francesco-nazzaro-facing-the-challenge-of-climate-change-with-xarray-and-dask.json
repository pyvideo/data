  "description": "In the last years climate change has become one of the most important\ntopic. For any period longer than a few days science is not able to\nprovide comparable forecasts, but still a lot of useful information\nabout future climate conditions can be gained on time scale of a few\nmonths to even several years.\n\nClimate forecast and climate projections data are quite complex to\nanalyse and represent. The Python science ecosystem proves extremely\neffective as a platform to retrieve, analyse, process and present\nthis type of data. The backbone of the platform is the n-dimensional\narray library xarray that provides the perfect mix between pandas\ndata structures and dask performance and parallelization.\n\nReliable climate forecasts and climate projections are now available\nfrom the Copernicus Climate Change Service, operated by ECMWF, that\nwill become the central hub for European effort in study and mitigate\nclimate change impacts. The service also provides access to an open\ncloud platform, the CDS Toolbox, that is based on the Python 3\nxarray/dask/pandas stack.\n\nIn this talk I will present how to retrieve, analyse, process and\ndisplay climate data in a generic use case with xarray and with the\nCopernicus CDS Toolbox.\n\nslides: http://slides.com/francesconazzaro/europython-2017",
