  "description": "In a coding competition you want to solve problems \"fast\"...\nwhy would you choose a \"slow\" interpreted language like Python?\nBecause the \"slow\" Python wins competitions more often that most people think.\n\nWe will show how coding competitions work, what are the resources and\nconstraints that competitors need to take into account, and we will find\nout that, like very often in real life, the actual processing time\nis only a small term in the complex equation that describe a competition.\n\nThe \"faster\" PyPy may help in gaining raw speed, but that is not the\nreal advantage it gives you in a competition.",
