  "description": "With 4 datacenters on-line and more coming fast, building and\noperating datacenter buildings becomes a problem we need to solve at\nscale. At Facebook, Several teams of Production Engineers write the\nsoftware that helps us do this efficiently, and we use Python... a\nlot.\n\nIn this talk, I will go into some detail about only some of problems\nwe try to solve to make sure our datacenters come online on time so\nthat we can make sure you can connect with all your friends on\nFacebook, and keep them humming, as efficiently as possible.\n\nWe'll go into some detail about the awesome Python infrastructure\n(some of it open source), that we use to build this software, and\nsome of the engineering practices.\n\nThis is a talk for you if you were wondering how to track each and\nevery strand of fiber cabling within a datacenter, or make sure we\nfind out that the cooling system isn't really doing it's thing before\nactual servers catch fire from serving you live videos.",
