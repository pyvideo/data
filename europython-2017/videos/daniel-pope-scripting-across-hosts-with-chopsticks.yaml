  Chopsticks lets your import and run Python code on remote Unix hosts
  over SSH. It works with no code deployment and no preinstalled
  software other than Python and SSH. It has built-in support for
  running code on many hosts in parallel.

  Unlike Fabric or Ansible, Chopsticks not opinionated about the
  structure of the code you run, allowing it to be used for
  orchestration, auditing, diagnostics, monitoring probes, and more

  Also unlike these, Chopsticks is not wedded to SSH, so it can
  transparently work on Docker containers over pipes, local
  subprocesses - and in future, sudo?

  Daniel will demonstrate Chopsticks in action, walk through the API,
  and explain the three clever tricks that Chopsticks is built on.
