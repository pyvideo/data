  "description": "When we write code, oftentimes things are not working as expected. We\nfollowed the tutorial and yet we got an error. We introduce a new\nfeature but something else broke.\n\nHaving to deal with bugs is inevitable. Trying to \"debug\" what\nhappened or what caused the problem can be really frustrating and\ntimewasting.\n\nThe aim of this talk is go give ways to think & steps to take\nwhen we are faced with the process of debugging.\n\nThe language for the examples is going to be Python & the tools\nused - from the python ecosystem.\n\nThe talk will be practical, with a lot of real-world examples.\n\nThe goal is to cover the following scenarios by showing different ways to approch the problem:\n\n- You followed a tutorial but it's not working. What to do?\n- You introduce new feature but things broke somewhere else in the project. What to do?\n- You are using a popular 3rd party library but something breaks. What to do?\n- A bug occurs and you have no idea what or who caused it. What to do?\n- You can't fix or find the bug. What now?\n- You want to generalize your debugging skills. How to do that?\n\nWe will be talking about critical changes, binary search, problem\nisolation, interactive debuggers, printing, testing, greping and\nother interesting things.",
