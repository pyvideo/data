  "description": "Exactly 23 years have passed since release of one of the biggest IT\nclassics - \"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented\nSoftware\".\n\nContents of the book had considerable influence on dominant\nprogramming languages of those days. However, design patterns were\nnot glorified by everyone. Voices of rational critic appeared,\npointing out that design patterns are just ways to compensate for\nmissing languages features by tons of clumsy code. If one implements\ndesign patterns in Python by the book, they will get code that looks\nawkward, at best.\n\nThis talk is to present Python's features that either simplifies or\neliminates need for implementing design patterns. Even if you don't\nknow what design patterns are - don't worry. You still may see some\nnew interesting Python's features and their usage.",
