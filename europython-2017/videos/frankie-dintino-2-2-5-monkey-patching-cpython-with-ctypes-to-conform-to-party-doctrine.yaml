  A few weeks into your tenure as a software engineer at the Ministry
  of Truth you are assigned your first real feature request: write a
  context manager that can make “2 + 2” equal 5 at runtime. Your
  solution should be written only in Python (for maximum portability).
  Absurd? Perhaps, but you know better than to ask questions. You are
  no thought-criminal.

  In this talk I walk through the steps I took to modify the value of
  two plus two in CPython at runtime—using only Python and the ctypes
  module. What began for me as a silly and frivolous side project
  became an education in how the python data model works behind the
  scenes and how CPython compiles, optimizes, and executes python code.

  The goal of this talk is to provide an introduction to CPython
  internals while walking through the steps needed to monkeypatch
  integer addition to make “2 + 2” equal 5. The audience should come
  away with a better understanding of how python objects and types are
  represented in memory, how references are counted, and how python
  scripts are transformed into abstract syntax trees, compiled into
  code objects, and then executed by the CPython virtual stack machine.
  And because I’ve limited myself to using ctypes, these topics can be
  explored without familiarity with C as a prerequisite.
