  "description": "Do you remember when you wrote your first line of code? Do you\nremember who inspired you  to become who you are when you were a\nchild? But also, what the challenges might have been?\n\nI remember when I was a little girl with a strong interest in a lot\nof things, including science, and what and who helped me pursue an\neducation and a career in science and technology. However, my journey\nin the industry from France to the UK, from software engineer student\nto team lead, from language processing to robots to online coding\ngames, made me understand there is still a lot of work to be done in\nterms of diversity.\n\nI will talk about my own experiences, what shaped my dreams and\ninspirations, the reality check, and the project I\u2019m now working on\nCode For Life.\n\nCode For Life is an initiative started at Ocado Technology in 2014,\nin response to the UK putting computing in the primary school\ncurriculum. It comprises a small full time team and also a large\ngroup of dedicated volunteers who focus on creating free, open source\ngames, mostly web games developed with Django, to teach all children\nhow to program. We are all dedicated to inspire all children and give\nthem the tools and opportunities they deserve.",
