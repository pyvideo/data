  "title": "What Streamlit Can and Can't (or Shouldn't) Do",
  "description": "Streamlit is a popular Python framework that allows you to build interactive web apps by writing only Python code.\r\nIt greatly simplifies handling interactivity, UI design, and some other difficulties in web development, for example by introducing a unique execution model and limiting the design/layout flexibility.\r\nSo sometimes we should be aware of its such characteristics and limitations in order to use it effectively.\r\nIn this talk, I will review Streamlit's features, discuss its pros and cons compared to other pure-Python web UI frameworks based on concrete examples, and suggest alternatives for some use cases where Streamlit is not the best fit.",
