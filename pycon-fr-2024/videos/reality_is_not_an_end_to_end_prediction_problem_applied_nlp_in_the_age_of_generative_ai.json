  "title": "Reality Is Not an End-to-End Prediction Problem: Applied NLP in the Age of Generative AI",
  "description": "Large Language Models (LLMs) and in-context learning have introduced a new paradigm for developing natural language understanding systems: prompts are all you need! Prototyping has never been easier, but not all prototypes give a smooth path to production. In this talk, I'll share the most important lessons we've learned from solving real-world information extraction problems in industry, and show you a new approach and mindset for designing robust and modular NLP pipelines in the age of Generative AI.\r\n\r\nBreaking down larger business problems into actionable machine learning tasks is one of the central challenges of applied natural language processing. I will walk you through example applications and practical solutions, and show you how to use LLMs to their fullest potential, how and where to integrate your custom business logic and how to maximize efficiency, transparency and data privacy.",
