  "title": "Python 3.12's New Monitoring and Debugging API",
  "description": "Python long lagged a good monitoring and profiling API. It had only the simplistic sys.settrace API, which had a high overhead and couldn't be configured appropriately. The new API, released in October 2023, will change this by offering a proper fine-grained and well-designed monitoring API while also making the commonly used operations fast.\r\n\r\nThis talk will give you an introduction to the new API and its design major design decisions and show you how you can use it to write a simple debugger from scratch.",
