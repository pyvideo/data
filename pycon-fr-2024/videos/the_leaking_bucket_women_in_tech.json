  "description": "Why do we see fewer women in tech, and how can we change this? This talk explores the journey of women in STEM, from young girls fascinated by science and technology to building successful IT careers. We will discuss the barriers women face, such as cultural stereotypes and lack of support, that cause the \"leaking bucket\" effect where women leave the tech pipeline at various stages.\r\n\r\nThrough real-life stories and data, we'll highlight the unique contributions women bring to the tech industry and the importance of their presence. Most importantly, we\u2019ll explore actionable strategies to support and retain women in tech, including mentorship programs, inclusive workplace policies, and community initiatives.\r\n\r\nUnderstand the what, why, and how of empowering women in tech and learn how we can all play a part in fixing the leaks in the bucket, ensuring more women not only enter but thrive in the world of IT.",
