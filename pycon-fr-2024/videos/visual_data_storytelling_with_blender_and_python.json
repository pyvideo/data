  "title": "Visual Data Storytelling with Blender and Python",
  "description": "You might have encountered beautiful animations and data storytelling through many educators and experimentalists online and wondered if it\u2019s only done in javascript or could also be done by Python. In this talk, the attendees will learn how to blend the 3D animation power of Blender with the 2D plotting capabilities from Python libraries like matplotlib. On top it, attendees learn how to leverage the latex and Manim library to create beautiful mathematical animations. \r\n\r\nWe will demonstrate some practical techniques to create immersive 3D models with Blender and enhance them with detailed 2D plots, providing a comprehensive narrative for data interpretation. By integrating these data-viz tools, devs and data enthusiasts will discover new & impactful ways to leverage Python to present and communicate their data insights from educational and work projects.",
