  "description": "I\u2019ve played Wordle most days since late 2021. Maybe you have too? One thing I wonder after solving the puzzle for the day is whether I made a bad choice of words. Should I have chosen SMASH, or STASH? Just how lucky was I to solve a puzzle?\r\n\r\nThis talk will explore how to implement a Wordle statistics bot using Python's concurrent processing tools. No spoilers, I promise.",
