  "description": "Shiny is a web framework that is designed to let you create data dashboards, interactive visualizations, and workflow apps in pure Python or R. Shiny doesn't require knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and lets you create data-centric applications in a fraction of the time and effort of traditional web stacks.\r\n\r\nOf course, Python already has several popular and high-quality options for creating data-centric web applications. So it's fair to ask what Shiny can offer the Python community.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will introduce Shiny for Python and answer that question. I'll start with some basic demos that show how Shiny apps are constructed. Next, I'll explain Transparent Reactive Programming (TRP), which is the animating concept behind Shiny, and the reason it occupies such an interesting place on the ease-vs-power tradeoff frontier. Finally, I'll wrap up with additional demos that feature interesting functionality that is made trivial with TRP.\r\n\r\nThis talk should be interesting to anyone who uses Python to analyze or visualize data, and does not require experience with Shiny or any other web frameworks.",
