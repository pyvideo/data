  "description": "Embeddings are a Large-Language-Model-adjacent technology that allow data such as text or images to be represented as an array of floating point numbers, representing a location in a weird, multi-dimensional space.\r\n\r\nThey are surprisingly powerful. Embeddings can be used to implement semantic search, find related content and even build text search against image data.\r\n\r\nI'll explain how they work, show you how to use them and teach you how to build weird and wonderful things with them that you couldn't build any other way.",
