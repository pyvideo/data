  "description": "Platform Engineering teams face unique challenges in product development organizations. They have a big mission\u2014enabling the rest of the engineering organization to move fast without breaking things\u2014while usually lacking product managers on the team. However, applying product principles can be useful in achieving that goal.\r\n\r\nOne key area Platform Engineering owns is how services are built and which tools are used. In this talk, we'll explore how a product-focused approach can guide creating principled developer products. Pulling from my own experiences, I'll share real-world insights and lessons learned as a Platform Engineer.",
