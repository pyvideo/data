  "description": "Building good containers for Python applications means dealing with several niggling pieces. Where do you get your Python? How do you install third-party packages? What kind of pinning should, and shouldn\u2019t you do? How do you configure your app?\r\n\r\nThe talk will cover how to containerize Python applications. It will start from going over choices for a base image, how to install Python on base images which do not include it, and how to get the requirements installed. The talk will cover the various trade-offs involved: building speed, how often to upgrade the image. It will also cover security best practices like setting the right permission on directories and running with the correct user.",
