  "description": "Docker and Poetry are tools often used to deploy Python code. Docker containerizes code, making it easy to deploy in the cloud. Poetry manages dependencies. However, did you ever consider how the two could work in concert to build slim, repeatable production containers for your code? \r\n\r\nThis talk aims to give developers the basics of setting up a Poetry project inside a Python Docker environment. The goal is to generate a secure container with only source code present\u2014no docs, tests, or secrets.\r\n\r\nWhat this talk isn't: A deep dive into Docker, Poetry, or virtual environments. \r\n\r\nslides/code: https://github.com/caheredia/pybay2023",
