  "description": "What do you do when your test suite is not fit for purpose? At Opto, we felt like we were locked in a daily battle against the tests written for our Java and TypeScript services. But, when we paired the adaptability of Python with the power of LLMs, we were able to enhance & extend what we had into something that really worked!\r\n\r\nJoin us on a journey of transformation where we'll cover:\r\n- Proactive Monitoring: Implementing \"production probes\" - lightweight and fast Python request \"tests\"- to actively ensure our services were up and executing core functionalities.\r\n- LLMs in Action: The unexpected efficacy of LLMs in aiding the creation of tests. We'll focus on our Python/TypeScript deployment tools here.\r\n- Quality Over Quantity: Recognizing that just writing tests isn\u2019t the end game. We harnessed FastAPI LLMs to swiftly assess our functional test coverage, helping us identify and address gaps.\r\n- Living Documentation: A sneak peek into how we've sown the seeds for dynamic, ever-evolving documentation using Python.\r\n\r\nThroughout the session, we\u2019ll touch on the trade-offs, democratization & ownership of tests, and how this little endeavor set the stage for Opto's broader embrace of Python.",
