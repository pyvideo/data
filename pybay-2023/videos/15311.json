  "description": "Using Python to write code for web applications, scientific applications, and data analysis is extremely popular. If you're here at PyBay, you're probably doing it.  And while there are desktop applications in Python, it's far less popular for that.\r\n\r\nThose of us who write that back-end code are typically sitting in front of desktop or laptop computers for 6-10 hours a day.  And yet, while we may want those machines to do certain tasks for us, for some reason it rarely occurs to many of us to use Python to solve problems on *those* computers rather than the ones in the cloud.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll explore some of the capabilities that local computation can give you which cloud and web applications can't, and look at some of the ways that Python can help you leverage that power.",
