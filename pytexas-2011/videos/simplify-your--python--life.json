Interfaces and getattr\n\n-  We'll see how delegation and interfaces tie into the thinking behind\n   GoF Design Patterns.\n\n",

  "summary": "We'll go over some intermediate to advanced topics and consider pros and\ncons of choosing the simpler approach vs. the possibly more complicated\nor redundant one. The aim is to reduce the number of language APIs and\nconstructs most programmers have to carry in their head to a smaller and\nmore coherent set. Along the way some best practices will also be\ndiscussed that are at a higher level than things that can be flagged by\nautomated syntax checking tools such as pylint, pyflakes, etc.\n",
