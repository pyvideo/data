Lets see what shinning advantages met us and what issues we, developers, had to work around.

Ten years later, the project is a success! Thanks to python?\n\nIn this Talk, we'll go over on the advantages of Python that helped the project both in its early life when so much feature needs to be implemented, but also nowaday when major companies like Facebook bet on Mercurial for scaling. We'll also point at the drawback of choosing python and how some work-arounds had to be found. Finally, we'll look at how the choice of python have an impact on the user too with a demonstration of the extensions system.",
