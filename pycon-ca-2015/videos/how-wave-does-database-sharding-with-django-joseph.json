  "summary": "Learn how we handle a large amount of data in Django by sharding the data using a developer friendly interface. I'll be talking about what we learned from our initial implementation and sharding style as well as the details we used in implementing a newer system.\n\nFirst, learn about why we shard, why you probably want to shard, what we originally tried and why it didn't work.\n\nNext, learn about how we re-implemented sharding including the router, unique id generation and all the code that went into the project.\n\nFinally, I'll touch on some of the more advanced topics such as shard re-balancing and dealing with replication lag time.",
