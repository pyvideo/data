  "summary": "Have you ever spent way too much time writing an API, and hoped there was a better way? Well, there is! The Django REST Framework (DRF) is a very generic framework for simplifying the creation of your API. In this talk, we will present how the DRF puts together serializers, validators, views, and everything else together into a flexible tool for creating any kind of REST API you may want. Like any framework, there are certain things it makes difficult to do, and we will talk about the problems we faced and solved while making our API do just what we wanted it to do.",
