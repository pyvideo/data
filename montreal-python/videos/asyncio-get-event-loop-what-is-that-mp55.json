  "description": "Montreal, Nov. 23, 2015 - Kamal Marhubi recently realized he had no idea how event loops worked. A couple of days later, he was looking at the asyncio source with a friend, and decided to share some of what they both found out. In this talk, you will find out what an event loop is, why you might want to use one, and you'll get a look at some of the key parts of the implementation in the standard asyncio module.\n\nRecorded and edited live by @ChristianAubry at Montr\u00e9al Python 55 (MP55: Wagnerian Xenosaurus) with a little big help from Savoir-faire Linux (http://sflx.ca/jobs).\n\n* About Kamal: http://kamalmarhubi.com/\n* About asyncio: http://sflx.ca/asyncio\n* About MP55: http://sflx.ca/MP55e",
