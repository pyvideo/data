  "description": "Montreal, April 14, 2014 - arkOS is an operating system and front-end software stack dedicated to setting up easy self-hosted servers on inexpensive hardware like the Raspberry Pi. arkOS' flagship tool Genesis manages all aspects of a system and its software, and is based entirely in Python. Lead programmer Jacob Cook walks through the software and its frameworks, how they work, and why self-hosting in principle is becoming more and more important.\n\nUseful links:\n* arkOS: https://arkos.io/\n* Jacob: https://twitter.com/peakwinter\n* MP46: http://sflx.ca/mp46e\n* Montreal Python: http://montrealpython.org\n* Savoir-faire Linux: http://www.savoirfairelinux.com",
