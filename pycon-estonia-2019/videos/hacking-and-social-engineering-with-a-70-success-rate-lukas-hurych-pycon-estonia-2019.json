  "description": "Luk\u00e1\u0161 is a product/marketing guy with a development background (Python is his biggest love but he went through Ruby, PHP, Swift, Javascript, Java). Studying psychology gave him a great knowledge of marketing, but the combination with Python is a killer for phishing, writing malware, hacking and all the fun stuff. He's doing all of this just as a hobby trying to test and protect his company and his team.\n\n----\n\nGet tickets for PyCon Estonia 2020 - https://bit.ly/pycon2020\n\nPython is nearing 3 decades in existence (yes, kinda hard to believe). Where do we go from here? We have the same question, hence PyCon 2019 will be a peek into the future of Python. Come, hang out with an inspired crowd, have rich, direct conversations and who knows, maybe you\u2019ll even find an answer.\n\nhttps://pycon.ee\nhttps://twitter.com/PyConEstonia\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/vaba-lava/pycon-estonia-2019/318811955508926/",
