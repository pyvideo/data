  "description": "Paul's background lay in mathematics and computer science. He has used Python over three years for developing open source text processing toolkit EstNLTK and its proprietary extensions that are used to extract facts and measurements from the health data records at the University of Tartu and STACC. He now works at Fujitsu and uses Python to improve Estonian e-government services.\n\n----\n\nGet tickets for PyCon Estonia 2020 - https://bit.ly/pycon2020\n\nPython is nearing 3 decades in existence (yes, kinda hard to believe). Where do we go from here? We have the same question, hence PyCon 2019 will be a peek into the future of Python. Come, hang out with an inspired crowd, have rich, direct conversations and who knows, maybe you\u2019ll even find an answer.\n\nhttps://pycon.ee\nhttps://twitter.com/PyConEstonia\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/vaba-lava/pycon-estonia-2019/318811955508926/",
