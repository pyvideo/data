Dom loves all things code, and is most recently exploring the world of Rust.\n\n----\n\nGet tickets for PyCon Estonia 2020 - https://bit.ly/pycon2020\n\nPython is nearing 3 decades in existence (yes, kinda hard to believe). Where do we go from here? We have the same question, hence PyCon 2019 will be a peek into the future of Python. Come, hang out with an inspired crowd, have rich, direct conversations and who knows, maybe you\u2019ll even find an answer.\n\nhttps://pycon.ee\nhttps://twitter.com/PyConEstonia\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/vaba-lava/pycon-estonia-2019/318811955508926/",
