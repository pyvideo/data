  "description": "Lauri has experience programming in Python for more than 10 years by now. Amongst other things Lauri has written Certidude in Python, an easy to use Certificate Authority software which he is using to issue VPN access at hackerspace he founded in October of 2017.\n\n----\n\nGet tickets for PyCon Estonia 2020 - https://bit.ly/pycon2020\n\nPython is nearing 3 decades in existence (yes, kinda hard to believe). Where do we go from here? We have the same question, hence PyCon 2019 will be a peek into the future of Python. Come, hang out with an inspired crowd, have rich, direct conversations and who knows, maybe you\u2019ll even find an answer.\n\nhttps://pycon.ee\nhttps://twitter.com/PyConEstonia\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/vaba-lava/pycon-estonia-2019/318811955508926/",
