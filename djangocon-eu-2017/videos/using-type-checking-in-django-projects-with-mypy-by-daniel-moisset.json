  "description": "Python has always been one of the most dynamic languages, and that's the most important factor in making it as flexible and expressive as it is. However, some recent efforts being done to also bring the world of static typing into Python, initially as a 3rd party project called mypy, and currently with some support in the core language in the form of PEP-484 + PEP-526.\n\nFrom some experiences with it, mypy improved the code I write in Python, but it's main blocker now is supporting the libraries and frameworks we all use. I'm currently working on bringing support for Django to be able to have type annotations in web development projects. This talk will describe the why using this tool helps you write code and can already make your web projects better.",
