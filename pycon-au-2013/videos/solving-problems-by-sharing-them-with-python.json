  "summary": "By using a variety of techniques and technologies, you can tap into the\nexpert knowledge of others more effectively. Revision control and code\nreviews are great for software quality, but not everyone is going to\nwork that way. Tools such as ipython notebook, sharing gists,\ndemonstration sessions and screencasts are a great way to get others\ninvolved in problem solving. Knowing how to use these tools quickly and\neffectively can also be a great way to explain problems to management,\nor to walk them through a complex requirement.\n",
