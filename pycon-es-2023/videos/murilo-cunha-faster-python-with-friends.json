  "description": "Ponente\nNombre: Murilo Cunha\nTítulo: Faster Python with friends\nSala: Tejita\n——————\n About the talk\n\nPython's flexible and intuitive syntax enables developers to quickly build applications. But on the other hand, it may be slow during runtime. There have been different attempts into making Python faster. In recent years, Python 3.11 was released and popularized as the \"faster Python\" and Mojo programming language was recently announced, advertised as having \"usability of Python with the performance of C\". Going back further, we see languages such as Cython, Just In Time (JIT) compilers and bindings.\n\nIn this talk, we'll go over the different approaches to increasing the speed of a Python application. We'll briefly explain how they work, compare the performance through a simple use case, and look at the limitations, tooling, trade-offs, and ease of use.\n\n Outline\n\nIntroduction and setup (3min)\nBaseline - Python 3.9 (3min)\nAlternatives (20min):\nPython 3.11\nCython & Mypyc\nPypy3\nPyO3\nMojo\nRecap and takeaways (4min)\n\n—\nPython España: https://es.python.org/\nPython Canarias: https://pythoncanarias.es/\nTwitter/X: @PyConES\nMastodon: https://fosstodon.org/@pycones",
