Ever try to do so, only to find that all of the good out-of-the-box options are coded to work with English text and not your desired input language? If you answered \"yes\" to any of the above questions, this talk is for you.\n\nSlides: https://goo.gl/PnWxFD\n--\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
