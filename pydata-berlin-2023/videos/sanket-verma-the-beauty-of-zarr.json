  "description": "In this talk, I\u2019d be talking about Zarr, an open-source data format for storing chunked, compressed N-dimensional arrays. This talk presents a systematic approach to understanding and implementing Zarr by showing how it works, the need for using it, and a hands-on session at the end. Zarr is based on an open technical specification, making implementations across several languages possible. I\u2019d mainly talk about Zarr\u2019s Python implementation and show how it beautifully interoperates with the existing libraries in the PyData stack.",
