  "description": "Jupyter Notebooks have been a widely popular tool for data science in recent years due to their ability to combine code, text, and visualizations in a single document.\n\nDespite its popularity, the core functionality and user experience of the Classic Jupyter Notebook interface has remained largely unchanged over the past years.\n\nLately the Jupyter Notebook project decided to base its next major version 7 on JupyterLab components and extensions, which means many JupyterLab features are also available to Jupyter Notebook users.\n\nIn this presentation, we will demo the new features coming in Jupyter Notebook version 7 and how they are relevant to existing users of the Classic Notebook.\n\nhttps://github.com/jtpio/pyconde-pydata-berlin-2023-jupyterlite-tutorial",
