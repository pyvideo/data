  "description": "Running machine learning models in a production environment brings its own challenges. In this talk we would like to present our solution of a machine learning lifecycle for the text-based cataloging classification system from idealo.de. We will share lessons learned and talk about our experiences during the lifecycle migration from a hosted cluster to a cloud solution within the last 3 years. In addition, we will outline how we embedded our ML components as part of the overall idealo.de processing architecture.",
