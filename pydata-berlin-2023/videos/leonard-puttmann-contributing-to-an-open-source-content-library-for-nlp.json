  "description": "Bricks is an open-source content library for natural language processing, which provides the building blocks to quickly and easily enrich, transform or analyze text data for machine learning projects. For many Pythonistas, contributing to an open-source project seems scary and intimidating. In this tutorial, we offer a hands-on experience in which programmers and data scientists learn how to code their own building blocks and share their creations with the community with ease.",
