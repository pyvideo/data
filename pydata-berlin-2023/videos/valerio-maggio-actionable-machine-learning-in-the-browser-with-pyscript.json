  "description": "PyScript brings the full PyData stack in the browser, opening up to unprecedented use cases for interactive data-intensive applications. In this scenario, the web browser becomes a ubiquitous computing platform, operating within a (nearly) zero-installation & server-less environment.\n\nIn this talk, we will explore how to create full-fledged interactive front-end machine learning applications using PyScript. We will dive into the the main features of the PyScript platform (e.g. built-in Javascript integration and local modules ), discussing new data & design patterns (e.g. loading heterogeneous data in the browser), required to adapt and to overcome the limitations imposed by the new operating environment (i.e. the browser).",
