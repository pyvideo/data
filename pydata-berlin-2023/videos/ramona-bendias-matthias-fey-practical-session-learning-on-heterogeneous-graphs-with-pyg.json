  "description": "Learn how to build and analyze heterogeneous graphs using PyG, a machine graph learning library in Python. This workshop will provide a practical introduction to the concept of heterogeneous graphs and their applications, including their ability to capture the complexity and diversity of real-world systems. Participants will gain experience in creating a heterogeneous graph from multiple data tables, preparing a dataset, and implementing and training a model using PyG.",
