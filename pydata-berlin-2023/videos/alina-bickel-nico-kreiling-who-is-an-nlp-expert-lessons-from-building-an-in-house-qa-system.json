  "description": "Innovations such as sentence-transformers, neural search and vector databases fueled a very fast development of question-answering systems recently. At scieneers, we wanted to test those components to satisfy our own information needs using a slack-bot that will answer our questions by reading through our internal documents and slack-conversations. We therefore leveraged the HayStack QA-Framework in combination with a Weaviate vector database and many fine-tuned NLP-models.\nThis talk will give you insights in both, the technical challenges we faced and the organizational learnings we took.\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/dt2nx7246jl753p/2023_who%20is%20an%20NLP%20Expert.pdf?dl=0",
