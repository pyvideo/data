  "description": "Python is a very expressive and powerful language, but it is not always the fastest option for performance-critical parts of an application. Rust, on the other hand, is known for its lightning-fast runtime and low-level control, making it an attractive option for speeding up performance-sensitive portions of Python programs.\n\nIn this talk, we will present a case study of using Rust to speed up a critical component of a Python application. We will cover the following topics:\n\n    - An overview of Rust and its benefits for Python developers\n    - Profiling and identifying performance bottlenecks in Python application\n    - Implementing a solution in Rust and integrating it with the Python application using PyO3\n    - Measuring the performance improvements and comparing them to other optimization techniques\n\nAttendees will learn about the potential for using Rust to boost the performance of their Python programs and how to go about doing so in their own projects.",
