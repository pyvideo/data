  "description": "Sometimes the internet can be a bit overwhelming, so I thought I would make a tool to create a personalized summary of it! In this talk, I'll demonstrate a personal front-page project that allows me to filter info on the internet on a certain topic, built using spaCy, an open-source library for NLP, and Prodigy, a scriptable annotation tool. With this project, I learned about the power of working with tools that provide extensive customizability without sacrificing ease of use. Throughout the talk, I'll also discuss how design concepts of developer tools can improve the development experience when building complex and adaptable software.",
