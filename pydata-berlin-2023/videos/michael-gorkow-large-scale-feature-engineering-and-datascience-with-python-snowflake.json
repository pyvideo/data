  "description": "Snowflake as a data platform is the core data repository of many large organizations. With the introduction of Snowflake's Snowpark for Python, Python developers can now collaborate and build on one platform with a secure Python sandbox, providing developers with dynamic scalability & elasticity as well as security and compliance.\n\nIn this talk I'll explain the core concepts of Snowpark for Python and how they can be used for large scale feature engineering and data science.\n\n\nSupporting material:\n- https://github.com/michaelgorkow/snowpark_pycon2023",
