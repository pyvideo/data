  "description": "I will present the challenges we encountered while migrating an ML model from batch to real-time predictions and how we handled them. In particular, I will focus on the design decisions and open-source tools we built to test the code, data and models as part of the CI/CD pipeline and enable us to ship fast with confidence.\n\nSlide: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FzP3KEpimIah67WUI_HQksdHGDWFR6gW/view",
