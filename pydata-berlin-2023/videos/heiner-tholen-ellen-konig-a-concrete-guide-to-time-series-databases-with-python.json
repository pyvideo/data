  "description": "We evaluated time-series databases and complementary services to stream-process sensor data. In this talk, our evaluation will be presented. The final implementation will be shown, alongside python-tools we've built and lessons learned during the process.\n\nUnderstanding time-series data is essential to handle automatically generated data, be it from server logs, IoT devices or any other continuous measurement.\n\nIn order to handle the large amounts of incoming data from concrete mixing trucks, we evaluated a number of time-series databases as well as services to stream-process the data. For all of those decisions a key question was, of course, how well any of these tools integrate with our existing, all-Python backend.\n\nThe right angle on time-series data will help you move tons of data with little engineering effort. In this talk, you'll learn from our practical experiences of choosing and implementing a time-series database in a Python context. You'll go away with a better understanding of how you can efficiently store, analyse and exploit streaming data.",
