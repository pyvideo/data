  "description": "The name WALD-stack stems from the four technologies it is composed of, i.e. a cloud-computing Warehouse like Snowflake or Google BigQuery, the open-source data integration engine Airbyte, the open-source full-stack\nBI platform Lightdash, and the open-source data transformation tool DBT.\n\nUsing a Formula 1 Grand Prix dataset, I will give an overview of how these four tools complement each other perfectly for analytics tasks in an ELT approach. You will learn the specific uses of each tool as well as their particular features. My talk is based on a full tutorial, which you can find under waldstack.org.",
