  "description": "In this talk, we will explore the role of a machine learning enabler engineer in facilitating the development and deployment of machine learning models. We will discuss best practices for optimizing infrastructure and tools to streamline the machine learning workflow, reduce time to deployment, and enable data scientists to extract insights and value from data more efficiently. We will also examine case studies and examples of successful machine learning enabler engineering projects and share practical tips and insights for anyone interested in this field.",
