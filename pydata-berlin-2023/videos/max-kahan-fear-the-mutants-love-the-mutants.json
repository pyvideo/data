  "description": "Developers often use code coverage as a target, which makes it a bad measure of test quality.\n\nMutation testing changes the game: create mutant versions of your code that break your tests, and you'll quickly start to write better tests!\n\nCome and learn to use it as part of your CI/CD process. I promise, you'll never look at penguins the same way again!",
