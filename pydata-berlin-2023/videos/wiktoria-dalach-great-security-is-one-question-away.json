  "description": "After a decade of writing code, I joined the application security team. During the transition process, I discovered that there are many myths about security, and how difficult it is. Often devs choose to ignore it because they think that writing more secure code would take them ages. It is not true. Security doesn't have to be scary. From my talk, you will learn the most useful piece from the Application Security theory. It will be practical and not boring at all.",
