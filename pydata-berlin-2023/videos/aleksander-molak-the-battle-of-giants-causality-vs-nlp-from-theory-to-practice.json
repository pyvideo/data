  "description": "With an average of 3.2 new papers published on Arxiv every day in 2022, causal inference has exploded in popularity, attracting large amount of talent and interest from top researchers and institutions including industry giants like Amazon or Microsoft. Text data, with its high complexity, posits an exciting challenge for causal inference community. In the workshop, we'll review the latest advances in the field of Causal NLP and implement a causal Transformer model to demonstrate how to translate these developments into a practical solution that can bring real business value. All in Python!",
