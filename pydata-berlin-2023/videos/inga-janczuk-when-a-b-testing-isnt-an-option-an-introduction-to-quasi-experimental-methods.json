  "description": "Identification of causal relationships through running experiments is not always possible. In this talk, an alternative approach towards it, quasi-experimental frameworks, is discussed. Additionally, I will present how to adjust well-known machine-learning algorithms so they can be used to quantify causal relationships.",
