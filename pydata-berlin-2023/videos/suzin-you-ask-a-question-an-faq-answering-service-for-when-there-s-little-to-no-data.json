  "description": "Doing data science in international development often means finding the right-sized solution in resource-constrained settings.\n\nThis talk walks you through how my team helped answer thousands of questions from pregnant folks and new parents on a South African maternal and child health helpline, which model we ended up choosing and why (hint: resource-constraints!), and how we've packaged everything into a service that anyone can start for themselves,\n\nBy the end of the talk, I hope you'll know how to start your own FAQ-answering service and learn about one example of doing data science in international development.\n\nSlide: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VeyPJiu5smmF9YpwdKQngNQdbEblBfc-/view?usp=share_link",
