  "description": "In this keynote, I will share the lessons learned from using Python in 4 industries. Apart from machine learning applications that I build in my day to day as a data scientist and machine learning engineer, I also use Python to develop games for my own gaming company, Quill Game Studios. There is a lot of versatility in Python, and it's been my pleasure to use it to solve many interesting problems. I hope that this talk can give inspiration to various types of applications in your own industry as well.",
