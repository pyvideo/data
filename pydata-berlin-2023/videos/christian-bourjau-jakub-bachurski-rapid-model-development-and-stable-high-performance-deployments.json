  "description": "At the boundary of model development and MLOps lies the balance between the speed of deploying new models and ensuring operational constraints. These include factors like low latency prediction, the absence of vulnerabilities in dependencies and the need for the model behavior to stay reproducible for years. The longer the list of constraints, the longer it usually takes to take a model from its development environment into production. In this talk, we present how we seemingly managed to square the circle and have both a rapid, highly dynamic model development and yet also a stable and high-performance deployment.",
