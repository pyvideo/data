  "description": "When building PyTorch models for custom applications from scratch there's usually one problem: The model does not learn anything. In a complex project, it can be tricky to identify the cause: Is it the data? A bug in the model? Choosing the wrong loss function at 3 am after an 8-hour coding session?\n\nIn this talk, we will build a toolbox to find the culprits in a structured manner. We will focus on simple ways to ensure a training loop is correct, generate synthetic training data to determine whether we have a model bug or problematic real-world data, and leverage pytest to safely refactor PyTorch models.\n\nAfter this talk, visitors will be well equipped to take the right steps when a model is not learning, quickly identify the underlying reasons, and prevent bugs in the future.",
