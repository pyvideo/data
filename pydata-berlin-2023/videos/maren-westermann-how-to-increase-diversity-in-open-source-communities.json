  "description": "Today state of the art technology and scientific research strongly depend on open source libraries. The demographic of the contributors to these libraries is predominantly white and male [1][2][3][4]. This situation creates problems not only for individual contributors outside of this demographic but also for open source projects such as loss of career opportunities and less robust technologies, respectively [1][7]. In recent years there have been a number of various recommendations and initiatives to increase the participation in open source projects of groups who are underrepresented in this domain [1][3][5][6]. While these efforts are valuable and much needed, contributor diversity remains a challenge in open source communities [2][3][7]. This talk highlights the underlying problems and explores how we can overcome them.\n\n\n[1] https://www.wired.com/2017/06/diversity-open-source-even-worse-tech-overall\n[2] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02777.pdf\n[3] https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8870179\n[4] https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9354402\n[5] https://biancatrink.github.io/files/papers/JISA2021.pdf\n[6] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.08777.pdf\n[7] https://blog.scikit-learn.org/events/sprints-value/\n\nhttps://github.com/marenwestermann/talks/blob/main/2023/PyConDE_PyDataBerlin/How-to-increase-diversity-in-open-source-projects-30-min.pdf",
