  "description": "A modern AI start-up is a front-end developer plus a prompt engineer\" is a popular joke on Twitter.\nThis talk is about LangChain, a Python open-source tool for prompt engineering. You can use it with completely open-source language models or ChatGPT. I will show you how to create a prompt and get an answer from LLM.
