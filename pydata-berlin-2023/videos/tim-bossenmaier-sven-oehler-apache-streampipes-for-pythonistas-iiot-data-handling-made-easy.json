  "description": "The industrial environment offers a lot of interesting use cases for data enthusiasts. There are myriads of interesting challenges that can be solved by data scientists.\nHowever, collecting industrial data in general and industrial IoT (IIoT) data in particular, is cumbersome and not really appealing for anyone who just wants to work with data.\nApache StreamPipes addresses this pitfall and allows anyone to extract data from IIoT data sources without messing around with (old-fashioned) protocols. In addition, StreamPipes newly developed Python client now gives Pythonistas the ability to programmatically access and work with them in a Pythonic way.\n\nThis talk will provide a basic introduction into the functionality of Apache StreamPipes itself, followed by a deeper discussion of the Python client. Finally, a live demo will show how IIoT data can be easily derived in Python and used directly for visualization and ML model training.\n\nExtra material: \n- https://github.com/bossenti/pycon-23-streampipes-pythonistas\n- https://pretalx.com/pyconde-pydata-berlin-2023/talk/LXBGZS/#:~:text=See%20also%3A-,slide%20deck%20(3.7%C2%A0MB),-Tim%20Bossenmaier",
