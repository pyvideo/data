  "description": "Many Python developers came to the language because of its elegance and\nstyling. However, we all have a different sense of style and often waste\ntime in code reviews arguing over different ways to format our code.\nThis talk will introduce you to a new tool called YAPF which takes a\nslightly different approach than other tools like autopep8 and pep8ify.\nWe'll talk about what is different about YAPF and why its approach is\nbetter suited to make us more happy and efficient developers. The talk\nwill also showcase some examples of YAPF in everyday use.\n",
