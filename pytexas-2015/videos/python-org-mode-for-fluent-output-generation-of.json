  "description": "Generating outputs (plots, tables, and texts) is an essential part of\nscientific research. Usually they are generated with scripts (either\n``.py or``.ipynb\\`), and a natural way of maintaining these scripts is\nusing either a long script file or multiple short files.\n\nWhen one has to update these outputs, the usual workflow is: 1) find the\nfile(s) and code block(s) inside the file that contains the code for\noutput generation, 2) re-learn what you did so you can edit the code,\nand 3) run the code to generate new outputs.\n\nEach of these steps has a cognitive overhead (non-fluency), which\nhampers your productivity, especially if it has been a while since you\nlooked at them. Using IPython Notebook facilitates some of the\nprocedures but it does not solve everything.\n\nIn this talk, I introduce org-mode and some of its functionalities for\nall three steps. org-mode is ideal for managing these tasks because it\ncan minimize the non-fluency. It has a convenient and flexible markup\nsyntax for hierarchical documents. It uses tree-like headlines, which\nmake it very easy to organize code and text. It provides a convenient\nway to collapse or expand headline blocks and navigate through them. In\naddition, one can execute a code block or export the results (or the\nsource code itself) conveniently inside org-mode. Theoretically, one can\nhave the entire contents and code for a paper and a presentation inside\none org file. I show examples of how one can leverage these\nfunctionalities to maintain outputs.\n",
