  "description": "Learn how to build a Two-player game using Python Tornado web framework. We will be using websockets to make the app realtime.\n\u200b\nAbstract\nWe will live code and learn how to build a real-time game app using Tornado web framework and websockets. Through this app, we will learn how to write an web app using Tornado web framework (http://www.tornadoweb.org/), and how to communicate over websockets. We will be building a Tic-Tac-Toe two-player game to learn about these concepts. A player can start a new game or accept a challenge from another player.\n\nWhen a player starts a new game, the app would create a new game channel, provide a handle to the channel that the player can send to his friend to join in and play. We will not be dealing with any authentication or logins to start a new game or to join an existing one. The goal is to show how easy it's to build an realtime app with Tornado.\n\n**Bio:** \nRamesh loves building data products that blend visualization and machine learning. He mostly uses Flask / Tornado to create web apps, Pandas / Scikit-learn for build machine learning models and D3 for visualizations\n\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/pybay2016/ramesh-sampath-building-a-tic-tac-toe-two-player-game-using-tornado-over-websockets",
