  "description": "Chady Dimachkie, Robin Kahlow, Dr. Jonathan Kernes and Dr. Ilia Zintchenko Present:\n\nUnderstanding Your Bank Statement in 100ms\n\nIn the last year, the global number of fintech companies has nearly doubled. Yet, despite the rapid growth, there is one area of banking that has been notoriously difficult to modernize: financial transactions. More than 1 billion transactions occur every day around the world. Transactions are different in every country and language, require knowledge of every merchant and location, depend on the context of the surrounding parties involved and are specific for each use case. At Ntropy, we enable developers to parse financial transactions in under 100ms with super-human accuracy, unlocking the path to a new generation of autonomous finance, powering products and services that have never before been possible. We will for the first time discuss the key parts of our pipeline, made possible by the latest advancements in natural language understanding and unsupervised learning.\n\nThis talk is geared at practitioners interested in knowing how bank transactions can be understood by a machine. Expert knowledge of machine learning is not required.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
