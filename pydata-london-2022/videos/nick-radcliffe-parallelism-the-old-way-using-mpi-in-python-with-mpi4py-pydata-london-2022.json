  "description": "Nick Radcliffe presents:\n\nParallelism the Old Way: Using MPI in Python with MPI4Py\n\nMPI is one of the oldest best-established and best-tested approaches to parallel computing, with bindings for most languages and availability on most systems. MPI uses explicit message passing and can be used on \"shared-nothing\" systems (in which each process/processor has its own memory, unavailable to other processors) as well as shared-memory systems, (uniform and non-uniform).\n\nThis tutorial will provide a gentle introduction to parallel computing using specifically MPI using the Python MPI4Py library.\n\nPresentation Deck: https://pydata.org/london2022/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/mpi-pydata-london-2022.pdf\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n\nWant to help add timestamps to our YouTube videos to help with discoverability?
