  "description": "Eyal Kazin Presents:\n\nDon't Stop 'til You Get Enough - Hypothesis Testing Stop Criterion with \u201cPrecision Is The Goal\u201d\n\nIn hypothesis testing the stopping criterion for data collection is a non-trivial question that puzzles many analysts. This is especially true with sequential testing where demands for quick results may lead to biassed ones. Kazin shows how the belief that Bayesian approaches magically resolve this issue is misleading and how to obtain reliable outcomes by focusing on sample precision as a goal.\n\nSlides: https://bit.ly/precision-goal\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
