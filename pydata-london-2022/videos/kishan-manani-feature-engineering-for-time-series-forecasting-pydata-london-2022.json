  "description": "Kishan Manani present:\n\nFeature Engineering for Time Series Forecasting\n\nTo use our favourite supervised learning models for time series forecasting we first have to convert time series data into a tabular dataset of features and a target variable. In this talk we\u2019ll discuss all the tips, tricks, and pitfalls in transforming time series data into tabular data for forecasting.\n\nGithub/Slides: https://github.com/KishManani/PyDataLondon2022\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
