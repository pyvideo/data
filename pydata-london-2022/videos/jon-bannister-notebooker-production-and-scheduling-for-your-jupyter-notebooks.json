  "description": "Jon Bannister Presents:\n\nNotebooker: Production and Scheduling for your Jupyter Notebooks\n\nNotebooker is an open-source web-based mongo-backed application which can help you turn your Jupyter Notebooks into reports which can be parametrised, scheduled, and shared in a few clicks. In this talk, I introduce Notebooker, how it works, and how it can help you.\n\nGithub: https://github.com/man-group/notebooker\nSlides: https://pydata.org/london2022/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/notebooker-pydata-2022.pptx\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n\n\nWant to help add timestamps to our YouTube videos to help with discoverability?
