  "description": "Gabor Bakos Presents: \n\nData Pipelining for Real-time ML Models\n\nReinventing the wheel is usually not something we should be striving for, so why did we build our data pipeline from scratch? There are numerous design choices people make and they can highly affect the potential use cases. When making a custom pipeline you can make your own trade-offs between speed, throughput, simplicity and consistency of code/logic/data.\n\nMarket makers like Optiver are usually associated with ultra-low latency infrastructure, however there are plenty of use cases where human latency (seconds) is acceptable. Computing derived metrics, training models and making predictions as new data arrives are just a few such applications and what we will focus on in this presentation.\n\nwww.pydata.org",
