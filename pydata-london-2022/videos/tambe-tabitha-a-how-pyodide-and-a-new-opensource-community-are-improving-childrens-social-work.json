  "description": "Tambe Tabitha Achere Presents:\n\nHow Pyodide and a new Opensource Community are Improving Children\u2019s Social Work\n\nSocial care workers support the most disadvantaged children in the UK and we help improve the sector with Data and Digital. Due to the extremely sensitive nature of the data in this context and long bureaucratic processes, data tools could neither be created to function on the internet nor could be installed by the users. This is a talk about how we coached social care workers to build a data cleaning tool and how Pyodide enabled it to scale. This talk is for people intrigued by complex problems. No previous knowledge is required.\n\nSlides: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-2SuSCjTYaHhAMC1QLnQlMAc2lGWhKVn/view?usp=sharing\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
