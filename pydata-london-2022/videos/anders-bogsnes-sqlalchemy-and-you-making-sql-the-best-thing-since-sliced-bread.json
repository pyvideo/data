Have you only used ORMs and want to start getting more control over your SQL?\n\nSQLAlchemy is the gold-standard for working with SQL in Python and this tutorial will get you comfortable with working in it so you can take advantage of its power. We will go through Core and ORM abstractions so you'll be comfortable navigating through the different layers and be able to fully use the power of Python when writing your SQL \n\nGithub Repo: https://github.com/andersbogsnes/pydata-london-2022-sqlalchemy-tutorial\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other.
