  "description": "Thusal Presents:\n\nFuzzy Matching at Scale\n\nFuzzy Matching is a useful tool that has been well discussed. However, these popular methods based on edit-distances like Levenshtein or Jaro-Winkler have failed to keep up with increasing data sizes. This talk will walk you through modern methods based on character-based n-grams, vector space models, and approximate nearest neighbours for Fuzzy Matching at Scale.\n\nThis talk provides a gentle and highly visual overview of some of the main intuitions and real-world applications of large language models. It assumes no prior knowledge of language processing and aims to bring attendees up to date with the fundamental intuitions and applications of large language models.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n\nWant to help add timestamps to our YouTube videos to help with discoverability?
