  "description": "Alexander Hendorf presents:\n\nLessons Learned About Data & AI at Enterprises and SMEs\n\nAll one needs is strategy, skill and resources to make digitalization and AI happen. So why is everything taking so long? Shouldn\u2019t you all be finished yesterday already? An honest talk about how to address the complexity of making data and AI happen in enterprises.\n\nMany incumbents are transitioning to new technologies while their businesses operate on systems that are years or decades old. Introducing new technologies is not just about introducing Open Source or introducing community culture or working agile or SCRUM or explaining complicated technology stuff to executives. The truth is: it requires all of it and likely even more. Mastering innovation requires having many balls in the air at once.\n\nIn this talk I'll present a transformation use case of an established player including our best practices and anti-patterns.\n\nWe will discuss the following aspects:\n- From idea to strategy\n- Assessing the status quo\n- Introducing Python and Open Source and what to use (or not)\n- Legacy is in the the house, still\n- Getting all departments on the same page\n- Introducing a community-driven collaborative culture\n\nSlides: https://pydata.org/london2022/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/LESSONS-LEARNED-ABOUT-DATA-AI-AT-ENTERPRISES-AND-SMES-PyData-London-22.pdf\n\nwww.pydata.org \n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
