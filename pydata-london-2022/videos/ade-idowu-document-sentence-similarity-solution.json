  "description": "Ade Idowu Presents:\n\nDocument/Sentence Similarity Solution Using Open Source NLP Libraries, Frameworks and Datasets\n\nThe need to develop robust document/text similarity measure solutions is an essential step for building applications such as Recommendation Systems, Search Engines, Information Retrieval Systems including other ML/AI applications such as News Aggregators or Automated Recruitment systems used to match CVs to job specification and so on. In general, text similarity is the measure of how words/tokens, tweets, phrases, sentences, paragraphs and entire documents are lexically and\u202fsemantically close to each other. Texts/words are lexically similar if\u202fthey\u202fhave similar character sequence or structure and, are semantically similar if they have the same meaning, describe similar concepts and they are used in the same context.\u202f\u202f\n\nThis tutorial will demonstrate a number of strategies for feature extraction i.e., transforming documents to numeric feature vectors. This transformation step is a prerequisite for computing the similarity between documents. Typically, each strategy will involve 4 steps, namely: 1) the use of standard natural language pre-processing techniques to prepare/clean the documents, 2) the transformation of the document text into numeric vectors/embeddings, 3) calculation of document similarity using metrics such as Cosine, Euclidean and Jaccard and, 4) validation of the findings\n\nGithub Repo: https://github.com/aidowu1/Ades-NLP-Recepies/tree/master/Exploration%20of%20Document%20Similarity%20Models\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n\nWant to help add timestamps to our YouTube videos to help with discoverability?
