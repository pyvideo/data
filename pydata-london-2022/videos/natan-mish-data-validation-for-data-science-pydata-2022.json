  "description": "Natan Mish presents:\n\nData Validation for Data Science \n\nHave you ever worked really hard on choosing the best algorithm, tuned the parameters to perfection and built awesome feature engineering methods only to have everything break because of a null value? Then this tutorial is for you! Data validation is often neglected in the process of working on data science projects. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate the importance of implementing data validation for data science in commercial, open-source, and even hobby projects. We will then dive into some of the open-source tools available for validating data in Python and learn how to use them so that edge cases will never break our models. The open-source Python community will come to our help and we will explore wonderful packages such as Pydantic for defining data models, Pandera for complementing the use of Pandas, and Great Expectations for diving deep into the data. This tutorial will benefit anyone working on data projects in Python who want to learn about data validation. Some Python programming experience and understanding of data science are required. The examples used and the context of the discussion is around data science, but the knowledge can be implemented in any Python oriented project. \n\nGithub Repo: https://github.com/NatanMish/data_validation\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n\nWant to help add timestamps to our YouTube videos to help with discoverability?
