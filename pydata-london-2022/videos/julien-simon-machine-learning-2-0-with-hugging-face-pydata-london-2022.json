  "description": "Julien Simon Presents: \n\nMachine Learning 2.0 with Hugging Face\n\nIn this session, we\u2019ll introduce you to Transformer models and what business problems you can solve with them. Then, we\u2019ll show you how you can simplify and accelerate your machine learning projects end-to-end: experimenting, training, optimizing, and deploying. Along the way, we\u2019ll run some demos to keep things concrete and exciting!\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
