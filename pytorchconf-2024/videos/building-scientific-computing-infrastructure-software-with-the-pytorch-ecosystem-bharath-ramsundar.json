  "description": "Building Scientific Computing Infrastructure Software with the PyTorch Ecosystem - Bharath Ramsundar, Deep Forest Sciences\n\nThe DeepChem library is a scientific computing library that implements deep learning infrastructure for drug discovery, materials discovery, and biology. The DeepChem community is one of the largest scientific open source projects built in PyTorch, with over 5K stars on Github and thousands of citations. The DeepChem community has learned a number of useful lessons for building and maintaining high quality scientific code built on top of PyTorch. In this talk, I will share our learnings with the PyTorch community and also highlight opportunities for improving scientific support in the ecosystem.",
