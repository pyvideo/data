  "description": "[MOJO] Lifting PT to New Heights with MAX and Mojo - Mikhail Zolotukhin, Modular\n\nIn this talk we'll peek into Modular's inference engine: how it builds on and works with PyTorch and what is unique about it. We will look into how Mojo language can be used to define performant kernels and what optimizations the inference engine can perform. We will also talk briefly about our experience of developing a third party backend for torch.compile.",
