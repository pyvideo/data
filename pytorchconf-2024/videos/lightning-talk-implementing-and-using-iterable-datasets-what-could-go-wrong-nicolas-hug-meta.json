  "description": "PyTorch supports two kinds of datasets: Iterable datasets and indexable \"map-style\" datasets. Iterable datasets can be more flexible and potentially faster than their indexable cousins. They are also much harder to use correctly, and can easily lead to silently wrong results. This talk is a quick and fun intro to some of the traps that Iterable datasets lay out for you, with some tips to help you avoid them.",
