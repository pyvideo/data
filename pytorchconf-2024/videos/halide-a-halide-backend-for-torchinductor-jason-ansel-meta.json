  "description": "[HALIDE] A Halide Backend for TorchInductor - Jason Ansel, Meta\n\nThis talk will focus on a new Halide backend for TorchInductor, which is in addition to the existing Triton and C++ backends.  The Halide backend is meant to serve as a reference backend to make it easier to extend TorchInductor to support new backend compilers and hardware devices.  Halide has been the inspiration (either in ideas or through forking) of numerous other compiler projects, so it is a good starting point for adding new backends that follow a Halide-like model.",
