  "description": "The State of the Llama Ecosystem - Joe Spisak, Meta\n\nAs open-source LLMs have become more capable, a substantial ecosystem has developed around the fine-tuning of these models. A thriving community of researchers, developers, practitioners and hobbyists has emerged which focuses on topics ranging from memory efficiency, parameter-efficient fine-tuning and quantization to performance at scale and reproducible evaluations. The goal of this mini-summit is to bring this community together to discuss ideas, share knowledge and build connections.\n\nThe agenda features a keynote from Joe Spisak on the state of the Llama ecosystem followed by invited talks from the founders of Axolotl, Unsloth and torchtune. We conclude the summit with a riveting discussion on what\u2019s next for LLMs, fine-tuning and the PyTorch ecosystem with a fabulous panel of experts - Tim Dettmers (author of bitsandbytes and QLoRA), Hailey Schoelkopf (maintainer of LM Eval Harness at EleutherAI), Aakanksha Chowdhery (Lead author on PaLM and Gemini) and Alexis Conneau (Research Lead at OpenAI)",
