  "description": "PyTorch/XLA recently launched the new PyTorch/XLA SPMD feature as a first-step to automate ML workloads parallelization using GSPMD. It turns out that the performance largely depends on the quality of sharding hints provided by the user \u2013 and it requires a correct and deep understanding of model architectures and much expertise to come up with optimal sharding hints. To address this problem, we propose to integrate PyTorch/XLA SPMD with XLA's auto sharding service that allows the XLA compiler to shard and optimize the whole model without any user input.",
