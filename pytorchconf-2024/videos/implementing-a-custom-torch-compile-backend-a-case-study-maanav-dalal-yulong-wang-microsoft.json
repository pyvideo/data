  "description": "Implementing a Custom Torch.Compile Backend - A Case Study - Maanav Dalal & Yulong Wang, Microsoft\n\nThis presentation will dive into the development of the ONNXRuntime (ORT) backend for torch.compile. We'll cover the implementation process, starting with a PyTorch 2.0 generated FX graph, highlighting the unique challenges encountered when serving ORT-specific scenarios and how we solved them. Attendees will gain insights into optimizing performance, overcoming integration hurdles, and achieving efficient execution. Whether you're a developer looking to extend PyTorch's capabilities for your own use cases, keen to learn about ONNX Runtime, or interested in backend performance optimization, and the many steps we've taken to get to where we are now, this session promises valuable takeaways and practical knowledge.",
