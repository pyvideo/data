  "description": "Lightning Talk: Extending PyTorch with Custom Python/C++/CUDA Operators - Richard Zou, Meta\n\nIn this talk, we'll go over the new recommended APIs to extend PyTorch with custom Python/C++/CUDA operators. Users have been able to extend PyTorch with custom operators for years but we have updated our guidance for creating custom operators that compose with torch.compile, autograd, and other PyTorch subsystems.",
