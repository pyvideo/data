  "description": "[TVM] Universally Deploy Large-language Models via ML Compilation - Tianqi Chen, CMU & OctoAI\n\nDeploying deep learning models on various devices has become an important topic. Machine learning compilation is an emerging field that leverages compiler and automatic search techniques to accelerate AI models. ML compilation brings a unique set of challenges: emerging machine learning models; increasing hardware specialization brings a diverse set of acceleration primitives; growing tension between flexibility and performance. In this talk. I then discuss our experience in bringing foundational models to a variety of devices and hardware environments through machine learning compilation.",
