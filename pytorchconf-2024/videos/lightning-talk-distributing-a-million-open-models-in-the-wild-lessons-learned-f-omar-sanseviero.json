  "description": "Lightning Talk: Distributing a Million Open Models in the Wild: Lessons Learned from the Hugging Face Hub - Omar Sanseviero, Hugging Face\n\nThe Hugging Face Hub has over 300,000 PyTorch models. Distributing such number of models poses challenges. In this talk, Omar will share how the community has tackled these challenges, including techniques to ensure torch model security and tooling for researchers to share their models. He'll also take attendees on a journey through the evolution of torch models distributed by the community, highlighting new trends and directions. Attending this talk will give attendees practical insights into the latest developments in model distribution and ecosystem trends.",
