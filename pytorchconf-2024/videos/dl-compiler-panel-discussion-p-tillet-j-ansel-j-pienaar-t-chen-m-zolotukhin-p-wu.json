  "description": "DL Compiler Panel Discussion - Philip Tillet, OpenAI; Jason Ansel, Meta; Jacques Pienaar, Google; Tianqi Chen, CMU & OctoAI; Mikhail Zolotukhin, Modular; Peng Wu, Meta\n\nSince the release of PyTorch 2 in 2023, torch.compile() has spurred significant new thinking around DL compiler designs at the framework level. In this session, we invite leaders in this space to share their insights based on real experiences of building DL compilers \u2013 Triton, TorchInductor, Halide, TVM, OpenXLA, and Mojo \u2013 and growing their ecosystems. We also invite a \u2018compiler user representative,\u2019 together.ai, to share their recent journey of redesigning the LLM inference stack around torch.compile(). Each leader will give a 10-minute lightning talk and an engaging panel discussion.",
