  "description": "Unlocking the Enigma: Crafting Unbiased, Transparent, and Explainable Large Language Models - Rashmi Nagpal, Patchstack\n\nIn an era where artificial intelligence reigns supreme, the statistics are both perplexing and thought-provoking \u2013 only a mere 13% of large language models manage to transcend the realms of research and enter the practical world of production. Who bears the responsibility when these models err, spewing out biased or discriminatory outputs? It's time to demystify the complex landscape of machine learning ethics and carve a path towards a brighter, more accountable future! In this talk, firstly, we will navigate the profound impacts of large language models across diverse domains, from the lifesaving advances in medicine to safeguarding our nations through enhanced security protocols. Secondly, as we marvel at data-driven decisions laid by these models, we will confront the darker shadows cast by \u2013 the looming spectre of bias in the data. Finally, we will delve deep into the art of building interpretable models and navigating the maze of ethical considerations. Through a live demonstration in PyTorch, we will witness how to craft unbiased, transparent, and explainable models.",
