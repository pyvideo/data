  "description": "Keynote: Enabling Generative AI on the Edge - Cormac Brick, Principal Engineer, Google\n\nGenerative AI is no longer just in the cloud - recently it's also getting deployed on edge devices. A disruptive goal of this work is AI-powered applications that respond instantly, work offline, and protect user privacy by processing data locally. In this talk, we'll explore the cutting edge of edge-based generative AI, showcasing open models that are pushing the boundaries of what's possible today on the edge. We'll dive deep into the PyTorch ecosystem, looking at projects that are making it easier than ever to author, optimize, and deploy these models across a wide range of devices.",
