  "description": "Torch.Compile for Autograd, DDP and FSDP - Will Feng , Chien-Chin Huang & Simon Fan, Meta\n\nIn this talk, we will present the latest advancements in torch.compile for distributed training via DDP and FSDP. We will first introduce Compiled Autograd, a torch.compile mode to fully capture the backpropagation step, including the communication collective operators used in distributed. We will then cover the improvements this new approach brought to Compiled DDP/FSDP, notably by removing DDP/FSDP graph breaks which brings the potential of improving compute/communication overlap.",
