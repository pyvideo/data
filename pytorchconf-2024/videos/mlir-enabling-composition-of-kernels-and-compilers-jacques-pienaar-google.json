  "description": "[MLIR] Enabling Composition of Kernels and Compilers - Jacques Pienaar, Google\n\nHand written kernels and compilers have been part of the toolbox to provide efficient and broad coverage. These approaches have often been positioned as being at odds with one another - and indeed the software solutions either side have sometimes made it such. MLIR, since inception, aimed to enable general, beneficial composition instead. Rather than treating kernels as a black box escape hatch, treat it as a peer in solving the serving needs. This is not magic and requires consideration of how best to combine. In this talk I'll present the approach and effect of this both in IREE and OpenXLA.",
