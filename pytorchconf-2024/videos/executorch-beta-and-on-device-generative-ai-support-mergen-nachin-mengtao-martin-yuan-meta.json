  "description": "ExecuTorch Beta and on-Device Generative AI Support - Mergen Nachin & Mengtao (Martin) Yuan, Meta\n\nDuring this session, we will discuss real-life case studies focusing on the productionization of PyTorch models onto edge devices and welcome the community to begin adopting ExecuTorch. Since announcing the ExecuTorch MVP at the previous PTC, we have made significant progress in terms of stability, model coverage, accelerator performance, and developer experience, reaching a milestone that marks the transition to beta status. In addition to the above improvements, we continue to support generative AI models. Since the alpha launch that initially enabled support for LLama2/3 models, we have now expanded our capabilities to include multimodal use cases and developed mobile demo apps showcasing these new features.",
