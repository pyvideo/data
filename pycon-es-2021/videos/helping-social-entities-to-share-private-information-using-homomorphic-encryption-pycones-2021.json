  "description": "Laia Auset Rizo nos presenta \"Helping social entities to share private information using homomorphic encryption\".\n\nResumen:\nData transfers pose many privacy concerns. In the case of federations where there is an organization that coordinates all the rest, data transfer between the sister organizations and the coordinator becomes a must in order to assure proper understanding of the whole group behavior and performance. This is key to measure their impact, define their budget plan, and even validate if the impacted population is the expected one.\n\nThen, the transfer of protected data such as gender and age is relevant, among others, to depict the impacted population. For that purpose we propose the use of a special kind of encryption that allows computation over encrypted data: homomorphic encryption. Thus, privacy barriers that inhibited data sharing are overcome.\n\n ---\nLa novena edición de la PyConES se celebra como un evento en línea y totalmente gratuito durante los días 2 y 3 de Octubre de 2021.\nWeb: https://2021.es.pycon.org\nAgenda: https://2021.es.pycon.org/#schedule",
