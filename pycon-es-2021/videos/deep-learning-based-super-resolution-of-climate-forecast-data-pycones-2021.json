  "description": "Carlos Alberto Gomez Gonzalez nos presenta \"Deep learning-based super-resolution of climate forecast data\".\n\nResumen:\nSeasonal climate predictions can forecast the climate variability up to several months ahead and support a wide range of societal activities. The coarse spatial resolution of seasonal forecasts needs to be refined to the regional/local scale for specific applications. Super-resolution, or statistical downscaling in the climate jargon, aims at learning a mapping between low and high resolution images (gridded climate datasets).\nIn this talk, I would like to explain how I developed deep convolutional networks in supervised and generative adversarial training frameworks for the task of super-resolving seasonal forecast of temperature over Catalonia. Additionally, I will stress on the importance of Python for scientific software development and for the application of cutting-edge machine learning and AI in Earth Sciences.\n\n---\nLa novena edición de la PyConES se celebra como un evento en línea y totalmente gratuito durante los días 2 y 3 de Octubre de 2021.\nWeb: https://2021.es.pycon.org\nAgenda: https://2021.es.pycon.org/#schedule",
