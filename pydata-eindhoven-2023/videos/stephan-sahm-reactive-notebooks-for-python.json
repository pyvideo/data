  "description": "Jupyter Notebooks revolutionized Data Science - Reactive Notebooks build on top of this giant. Reactivity solves a couple of problems:\n\nImproved safety: It is impossible to get into an invalid state (where you would hit \"rerun all\" in Jupyter).\n\nSimplified interactivity: Changing a value also updates those cells which depend on it.\n\nSimplified deployment: The notebook itself is already a dashboard (with fully customizable html frontend).\n\nIn addition, the new notebook allows for self-updates, i.e. listening for some remote events and rerunning notebook cells automatically with the new updated value. This upgrades your notebook to a real-time analytics process.\n\nIn this talk I will present the new notebook and go through all its powerful features.",
