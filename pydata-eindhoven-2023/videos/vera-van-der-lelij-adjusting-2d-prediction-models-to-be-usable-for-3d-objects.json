  "description": "With the rise of 3D printing/scanning, a significant increase in available 3D datasets has taken place. However, most 3D research focusses on classification, recognition or shape analysis of 3D objects. For the past 1,5 year we have researched the subject of predicting growth of natural growing 3D objects using machine learning techniques. During this talk we would like to share our findings and the challenges we encountered when working on this research. The presentation will be structured as follows:\n\nIntroduction and use case (5 minutes)\nBasic 3D-techniques using open3d package (5 minutes)\nSolution method (10 minutes)\nSummary and future research (5 minutes)\nQ&A (5 minutes)",
