  "description": "Background removal is a process in image editing and computer vision where the main subject of an image is isolated from its background. Among many spheres where it is applied, product design is one where it is heavily relied upon.\nThe talk is catered primarily towards data scientists and Python enthusiasts who would love to know more about practical computer vision problems. During this presentation, you will learn about our approach to how background removal was tackled in a print-on-demand company with no ground truth data, see how initial research can be done (even without a pricey GPU-based instance), get to see iterative improvements in the results and understand how eventually domain-centric training results can compare to external providers.",
