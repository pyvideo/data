  "description": "pixi is changing the field for software environment management. pixi bridges the gap between conda and pip with a single binary tool that automatically generates lock-files and can be configured with a single configuration file. While we build on the conda ecosystem, we\u2019re also integrating PyPi (pip) into pixi. This way you\u2019ll only need one tool across all platforms.",
