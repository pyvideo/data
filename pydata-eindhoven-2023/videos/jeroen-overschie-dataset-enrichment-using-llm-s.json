  "description": "Welcome! Let's discover more about LLM's together. You will learn about how to tame the LLM to get the output you want in a playful way \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb.\n\nJoin us if you \ud83e\udef5:\n- Are interested in LLM's\n- Want to know how you can use LLM's to extract structured information from text\n- You know some Python\n\nContents of the talk \ud83d\udccc:\n[1 min] Intro\n[3 min] The current state of LLM's\n[3 min] Usecase: dataset with mixed structured/unstructured data\n[10 min] Prompt engineering\n[8 min] Going structured (JSON, Function Calling)\n[5 min] Conclusion & results\n\ud83c\udfe1 What you will take home\nAt the end of the talk, you will be taking home the following:\n- What LLM's are currently around and how the landscape looks like\n- How you can use a LLM to gather extract previously hidden features\n- How you should deal with LLM's deviating from the requested output protocol\n- What Function Calling is and how you can use it to your advantage\n- How different LLM's perform (GPT, PaLM, ...) for extracting data from the housing usecase \ud83c\udfe1\n\n\u2764\ufe0f Open Source Software\nThe Python libraries used to access the LLM and post-process the LLM results are openai and instructor, which are both Open Source. The LLM's used are hosted by cloud providers but could alternatively be swapped out for Open Source alternatives.\n\n\ud83c\udf92 Pre-requisites\nSome Python knowledge is recommended, but the talk can also be followed without! For the rest no previous knowledge about LLM's is required \u2713.",
