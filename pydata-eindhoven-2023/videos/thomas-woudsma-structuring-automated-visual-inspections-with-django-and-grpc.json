  "description": "Setting up an ML application by creating some ad-hoc dataset and training a model with an unversioned Python script just does not cut it anymore. The MLOps process helps to structure the development and life cycle of any ML application to make sure that data is traceable, and performance is reproducible. In this talk, an automated visual inspection application is used as an example to show a data definition and labeling platform using Django, and an image ingress and streaming service using gRPC. This system can serve as an example for any future ML application as the same principles can be applied. A demonstration of this system is also shown at the end of the session. Having some basic knowledge of Django and gRPC is preferred, but it is not required.",
