  "description": "You love using notebooks for data science? So do we!\n\nWe've built everything you need to seamlessly transition from experimenting and developing in a notebook to automated testing and finally deploying it for production. You can transform your notebook into a dashboard, a real-time process, perform big data analysis (coming soon), or create a self-updating report.\n\nEverything is still just a notebook. It's scientists-friendly, promotes collaboration, and is ready for both you and your company.\n\nStart right away at cloud.jolin.io or reach out to us for a custom deployment within your infrastructure.",
