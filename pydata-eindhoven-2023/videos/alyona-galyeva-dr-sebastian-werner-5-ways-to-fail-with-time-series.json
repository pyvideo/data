  "description": "Time series data is ubiquitous in our world today: from sensor data collected by the Internet of Things (IoT) to sensors in manufacturing equipment, from financial records to weather data. As the amount of time series data we collect continues to grow, so too do the challenges of analyzing and solving complex business questions with it.\nTime series pose some quite unique challenges that can hit you very hard when you are trying to deploy it to productive use. In this presentation we will highlight some of the most common pitfalls we are recurrently seeing in the field - to spoiler some: time zones, denoising or re-training challenges.\nIn addition, we will also discuss some of the specifics of doing data science with this type of data at scale (and in production).",
