  "description": "Large language models are all the rage, but building scalable applications with them can be costly and difficult. In this talk, we give you a glimpse at the emerging ecosystem of LLM apps beyond just ChatGPT. In particular, we focus on OSS alternatives, like the Llama model family, and show you how to use them in your own projects.
