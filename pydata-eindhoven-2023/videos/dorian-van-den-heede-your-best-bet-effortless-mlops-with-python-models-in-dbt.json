  "description": "In just a few short years, dbt has taken the data engineering world by storm, becoming the de facto standard for data transformation pipelines. Its primary strength, which endures, is SQL, a ubiquitous programming language shared by data analysts, scientists, and engineers.\n\nHowever, there are limitations to what SQL can achieve. With the introduction of Python models since version 1.3, data pipelines in dbt have become significantly more expressive, to the extent that you can implement and orchestrate entire batch machine learning pipelines. By harnessing the inherent power of dbt-core, classic SQL, and the richness of Python and its ecosystem, you can finally create a machine learning workflow that is accessible to everyone on your team.\n\nIn this talk, we will delve into the dos and don'ts of using Python models in dbt, illustrated through an exemplary daily-running machine learning pipeline aimed at beating football odds provided by bookmakers, utilizing the European Soccer Dataset. By the end of this session, you will have a firm grasp of key design patterns for a successful machine learning project within dbt.\n\nPrerequisites:\n- Required: python, SQL, a base understanding of ML\n- Optional: dbt, JinJa, MLOps concepts",
