  "description": "Quantization is a process of mapping continuous values to a finite set of discrete values. It is a powerful technique that can significantly reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of deep learning models, making them more efficient and easier to deploy on resource-constrained devices. In this talk, we will explore the different types of quantization techniques and discuss how they can be applied to deep learning models. In addition, we will cover the basics of NNCF and OpenVINO Toolkit, seeing how they collaborate to achieve outstanding performance - everything in a Jupyter Notebook, which allows you to try it at home.",
