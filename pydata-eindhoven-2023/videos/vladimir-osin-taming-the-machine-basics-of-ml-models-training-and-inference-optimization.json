  "description": "This introductory talk is designed to address the prevalent industry challenge of Machine Learning (ML) model deployment. Given the plethora of frameworks, compilers, and runtimes, ML engineers and Data Scientists often find this a daunting task. Our discussion will traverse all phases of this process, aiming to simplify the complexity.\n\nWe'll initiate the discussion with the ecosystem, tools, and methods, focusing initially on the training stage before transitioning to the inference stage. Beginning with a model in Jupyter Notebook, we'll illustrate how to expedite training time utilizing auto mixed precision, multiple GPUs, batch-size strategies, and JIT compilation. Subsequently, we'll concentrate on how to fine-tune your model inference for specific target hardware using necessary tools (NVIDIA Tensor RT (LLM) and Triton, ONYX) or adopting a more comprehensive approach with the new Mojo programming language.\n\nTarget Audience\nOur primary audience is Machine Learning Engineers, Data Scientists, Software Engineers, and students aspiring to these roles. A basic understanding of Python and a healthy dose of enthusiasm are the sole prerequisites for this seminar.\n\nAgenda\n0-5 mins: Introduction to the Ecosystem and Tooling\n5-15 mins: Strategies to Accelerate Model Training\n15-25 mins: Techniques to Boost Model Inference\n25-30 mins: Concluding Remarks and Future Directions",
