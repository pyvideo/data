  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nOn a global scale we are growing numb to stories in the news about machine learning algorithms causing real-world harm. People's lives and livelihood are affected by the decisions made by machines. Learn about how bias can take root in machine learning algorithms, how the rise of foundation models and Large Language Models (LLMs) have impacted this phenomenon, and ways to overcome it. From the power of open source, to tools built to detect and remove bias in machine learning models, there is a vibrant ecosystem of contributors who are working to build a digital future that is inclusive and fair. Now you can become part of the solution.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
