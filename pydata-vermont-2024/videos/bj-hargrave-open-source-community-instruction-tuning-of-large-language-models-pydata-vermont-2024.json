There are many popular open LLMs, just look at Hugging Face. Up until now, if a developer wanted to contribute a change to an open LLM, the only practical option was to publish a fork of the model which results in many forks but no version of the model having all or many of the community\u2019s changes. In this session we learn about a new, novel technique using the InstructLab open source project to enable incremental, community contributions to instruction-tune a LLM.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
