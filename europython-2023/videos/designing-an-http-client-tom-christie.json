It also includes a built-in command-line client.\n\n\rWe'll be taking a look at the architecture of the client, learning from the design decisions behind it, and gaining a better understanding of HTTP along the way.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
