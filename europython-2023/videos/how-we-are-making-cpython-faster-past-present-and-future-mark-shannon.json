  "description": "[EuroPython 2023 \u2014 Forum Hall on 2023-07-19]\nhttps://ep2023.europython.eu/session/how-we-are-making-cpython-faster-past-present-and-future\n\nPython 3.11 is considerably faster than 3.10. \n\rHow did we do that? And how are we going to make 3.12 and following releases even faster?\n\n\r In this talk, I will present a high level overview of the approach we are taking to speeding up CPython. Starting with a simple overview of some basic principles, I will show how we can apply those to streamline and speedup CPython. I will try to avoid computer science and software engineering terminology, in favor of diagrams, a few simple examples, and some high-school math. Finally, I make some estimates about how much faster the next few releases of CPython will be, and how much faster Python could go.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
