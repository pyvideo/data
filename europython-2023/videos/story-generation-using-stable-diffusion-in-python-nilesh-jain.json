  "description": "[EuroPython 2023 \u2014 South Hall 2B on 2023-07-20]\n\rhttps://ep2023.europython.eu/session/story-generation-using-stable-diffusion-in-python\n\nRecently, most works focus on synthesizing independent images, while for real-world applications, it is common and necessary to generate a series of coherent images for story-telling. In this work, we mainly focus on story visualization and continuation tasks and propose AR-LDM, a latent diffusion model auto-regressively conditioned on history captions and generated images. To my best knowledge, this is the first work successfully leveraging diffusion models for coherent visual story synthesizing.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
