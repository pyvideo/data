  "description": "[EuroPython 2023 \u2014 Forum Hall on 2023-07-21]\n\rhttps://ep2023.europython.eu/session/the-pythons-stability-promise\n\nMany modules you use and love have a portion of their implementation written in other languages, and for that a Python extension need to be made.\n\rPython offers a C-API that allow people extending the language, and being a nice glue-language, C is also a bridge to many other languages as well.\n\n\rSo if everything is simple, what's the deal with stability?\n\rChanges in the C-API might break the functionality in older versions, so PEP 387 saves the day with a policy for backward compatibility.\n\rStarting from Python 3.2, the Limited API was introduced, which defined a subset of Python's C-API that it's promised that if used, the code can be compiled in one version, and run in many others as well.\n\n\rAlso, having a Stable ABI compatible wheel, allow you to only have one-wheel-per-OS, and not one-wheel-per-python-version, which can simplify your release process.\n\n\rThis talk will introduce the Limited API concept, and provide the necessary information to include it in your project.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
