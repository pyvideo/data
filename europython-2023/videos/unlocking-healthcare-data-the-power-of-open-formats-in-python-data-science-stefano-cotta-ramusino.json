Are you tired of dealing with proprietary data formats for biological and vital sign information? It's time to unlock the power of open data and make your research more impactful.\n\n\rIn this talk, we'll explore how you can leverage Python analytics to manipulate and analyze complex datasets of patient information, including blood work, ECG, EEG, echocardiography, radiography, and more.\n\n\rWe'll also dive into the world of open data formats, and show you how using these formats can make it easier to anonymize, convert, and collaborate on research.\n\n\rDon't miss this opportunity to learn how Python analytics and open data formats can help you unlock the insights hidden in your data and improve patient outcomes.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
