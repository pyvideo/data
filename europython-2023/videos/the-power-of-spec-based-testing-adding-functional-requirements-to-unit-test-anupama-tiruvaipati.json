But, with so many testing techniques available, it can be challenging to know which one to use. While unit testing is a popular technique, it's not always the most effective or efficient way to ensure software quality. In this talk, we\u2019ll explore spec-based testing, a technique that focuses on verifying that the software behaves in accordance with its specifications or requirements.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
