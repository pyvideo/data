How to leave codebase easier to deal with for your colleagues so they don\u2019t have to suffer like you did?\n\n\rIf you are experienced developer or a junior just starting your journey, inheriting codebase can be a very challenging task. Especially if the codebase is not quite up to your standards, or it\u2019s just huge and complex beast.\n\n\rI will convey my experience and tips and tricks on inheriting code I acquired during 12 years of software development on new and old projects.\n\n\rThe talk will provide guidelines to ease taking over code from somebody else, as well as remind developers of the importance that planning, preparation and documentation have in facilitating code change and project growth.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
