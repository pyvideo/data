  "description": "[EuroPython 2023 \u2014 North Hall on 2023-07-20]\n\rhttps://ep2023.europython.eu/session/cultivating-a-performance-mindset\n\nAs developers, we learn early on that it\u2019s important to focus on getting our code to work without unnecessarily pre-optimizing, but how do we learn to eventually optimize our code? What do we look for? How do you know when something is slow? How do you **do** something about it?\n\n\rIn this talk, we\u2019ll discuss why your application performance matters, how you can learn to identify what matters most to you, and how Sentry has you in mind so you can effectively spend time improving the performance of critical user flows in your application.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
