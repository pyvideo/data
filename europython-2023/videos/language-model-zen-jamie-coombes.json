  "description": "[EuroPython 2023 \u2014 Terrace 2A on 2023-07-21]\n\rhttps://ep2023.europython.eu/session/language-model-zen\n\nBeautiful is better than ugly.\n\n\rThe frontier of AI Language Models awaits exploration.\n\n\r We, Pythonistas, face choices on how to use these tools.\n\n\rAdvanced models like GPT-4, BARD, and LLaMa generate human-like responses.\n\n\rThe nature of Language Models is fear,\n\n\rBut tools like TransformerLens show The Way.\n\n\rUnderstanding The Model is possible.\n\n\rThe nature of Language Models is excitement.\n\n\rUsing them out of the box is one option.\n\n\rPrompt engineering is another.\n\n\rChatGPT plugins and LangChain offer a third choice.\n\n\rFine-tuning them presents a fourth.\n\n\rTraining them from scratch is the fifth option.\n\n\rNot using them at all is the final option. It may be safer.\n\n\rThe output for one LM is the prompt for another.\n\n\rWhile openai is an excellent library, and\n\n\rLangChain composes language models and utilities.\n\n\rGPT's plugin system also composes language models and utilities, and\n\n\rThere should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
