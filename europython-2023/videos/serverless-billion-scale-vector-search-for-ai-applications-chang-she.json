Existing vector solutions are complicated to use, hard to maintain, and cost too much. LanceDB is a free open-source vector store that can perform low latency vector search on billion-scale vector datasets on a single node.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
