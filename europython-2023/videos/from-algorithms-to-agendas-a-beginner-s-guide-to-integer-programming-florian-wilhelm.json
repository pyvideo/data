We will explore the basics of Integer Programming and how it can be applied to optimize the allocation of talks to time slots and rooms in a conference program. By the end of the talk, attendees will have a better understanding of how this powerful tool can help to create an efficient and effective conference schedule that maximizes attendee satisfaction. Whether you're a conference organizer or simply interested in learning more about optimization algorithms, this talk is for you!\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
