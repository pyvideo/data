Now, with the integration of [ipyvizzu](https://ipyvizzu.vizzuhq.com/latest/) - a new, open-source data visualization tool focusing on animation and storytelling - you can quickly create and publish interactive, animated reports and dashboards on top of static or dynamic data sets and your models.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
