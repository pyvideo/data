Thanks to a magical potion in an ancient flask, our wizardly skills have been enhanced with Pythonic capabilities \ud83d\udc0d making us the most powerful and geeky magician of the realm. \rThese new acquired power revealed _unprecedented strategies_ (i.e. algorithms \ud83d\ude43) that will guide us through the maze avoiding all the traps and pitfalls \u2694\ufe0f, and will help us maximising the power of our _fire magic_ \u2604\ufe0f to finally slay the dragon.\n\n\rIf you would like to know more about this new Pythonic spell, and the secrets it unveiled, or if you're simply interested in *new graph algorithms* that can run balzingly _fast_ maximising your CPU capabilities, *this is the talk for you!*\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
