While most users are happy with the recommendations provided, there are a section of users who are curious how and why a certain track is recommended. Complex recommendation systems take various factors like track metadata, user metadata, and play counts along with the track content itself. \n\n\rInspired by Andrej Karpathy to build an own GPT, we have to use Language Models to build our own music recommendation system.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
