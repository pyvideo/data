  "description": "[EuroPython 2023 \u2014 Forum Hall on 2023-07-21]\n\rhttps://ep2023.europython.eu/session/power-django-with-pycharm\n\nDjango and Python make fullstack and API web projects a breeze. But as Python has matured, significant tooling has risen to improve the development experience (DX). Can you use this tooling, in a modern editor and IDE, to stay in the flow and make your development\u2026joyful?\n\n\rIn this session we\u2019ll put PyCharm to work, at helping us work. Navigation, refactoring, autocomplete \u2013 the usual suspects. We\u2019ll also see \u201ctest-first\u201d development to stay in the IDE, plus how this can apply to frontends.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
