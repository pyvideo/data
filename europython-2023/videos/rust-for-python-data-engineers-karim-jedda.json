  "description": "[EuroPython 2023 \u2014 South Hall 2B on 2023-07-19]\n\rhttps://ep2023.europython.eu/session/rust-for-python-data-engineers\n\nPython is a popular language for data engineering but has some limitations in performance, concurrency, and production deployments. The Rust programming language offers powerful alternatives with strong compile-time and memory safety guarantees. In this talk, I'll explore how data engineers can leverage Rust to build high-performance data pipelines and processing systems. I'll cover the Rust ecosystem for data work, including frameworks and libraries for working with data formats, databases, streaming systems, and scientific computing. By combining Rust and Python, data engineers can harness the benefits of both languages and build robust end-to-end data systems that scale to meet demanding production needs.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
