  "description": "[EuroPython 2023 \u2014 South Hall 2B on 2023-07-21]\n\rhttps://ep2023.europython.eu/session/orchestrating-python-workflows-in-apache-airflow\n\n[**Apache Airflow**](https://github.com/apache/airflow) is an Open Source workflow orchestrator. It is a python library that allows you to automate complex code and integrate it with a plethora of Data Sources. It is provided with an integrated UI and API for both your human and programmatic needs.\n\n\rAfter 5 years of running Airflow in production, I hope to share some insights on the technology. The strengths and weaknesses, recommended features and more dangerous ones, and similar considerations on the UI.\n\n\rI'll also be talking about how **you** can make your own *Operators* in Airflow.\n\n\rCome take a deeper dive into the same solution used by Airbnb, Slack, Walmart and many more to efficiently run their data pipelines.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
