Additionally, I will live demo the model's capabilities in three languages, showing how you can use it on your own computer to generate English subtitles for a wide range of content.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
