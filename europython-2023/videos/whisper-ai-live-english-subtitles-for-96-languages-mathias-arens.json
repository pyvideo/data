  "description": "[EuroPython 2023 \u2014 Terrace 2B on 2023-07-20]\n\rhttps://ep2023.europython.eu/session/whisper-ai-live-english-subtitles-for-96-languages\n\nWhisper AI, a model from OpenAI, has been largely overlooked despite its impressive ability to accurately transcribe and translate human speech from audio.\n\n\rIn this talk I will explore the architecture of the model and explain why it works so well. Additionally, I will live demo the model's capabilities in three languages, showing how you can use it on your own computer to generate English subtitles for a wide range of content.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
