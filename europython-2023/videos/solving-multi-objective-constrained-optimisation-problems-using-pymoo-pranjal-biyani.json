It provides an object oriented interface to solve constrained Single/Multi-Objective optimisation problems with a catalog of algorithms, customisations and post-optimisation evaluation functionalities. With additional features like Visualisation of optimal pareto-fronts, decision making, parallelization and customised sampling, Pymoo promises to be highly valuable for scalable optimisation solutions.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
