How similar are they, and at which distance do they tend to be correlated?\n\r- Do you have access to a few air pollution measurements but must provide a smooth map over the whole area?\n\r- Is your machine learning model based on remote sensing data from Earth Observation satellites, and do you want to include data sampled on Earth?\n\r- Do you work with county-level socio-economic factors, but you want to get insights at a finer scale?\n\n\r`if any(answer)`, then come and see what we can do with the `pyinterpolate` package designed exactly for spatial interpolation!\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
