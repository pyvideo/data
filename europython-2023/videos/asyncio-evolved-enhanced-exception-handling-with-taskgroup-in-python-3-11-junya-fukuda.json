  "description": "[EuroPython 2023 \u2014 Terrace 2A on 2023-07-21]\n\rhttps://ep2023.europython.eu/session/asyncio-evolved-enhanced-exception-handling-with-taskgroup-in-python-311\n\nWith the release of Python 3.11 in October 2022, PEP 654 \"Exception Groups and except\" was accepted, and asyncio.TaskGroup() was added. This enhancement of exception and cancellation handling has allowed asyncio to evolve more flexibly, addressing the existing issues with asyncio APIs, such as insufficient cancellation and exception handling in asyncio.gather.\n\n\rIn this talk, I would like to discuss the problems of existing asyncio APIs and how the newly introduced asyncio.TaskGroup() solves these issues. Attendees will learn about the improved way of handling exceptions and cancellations using asyncio.TaskGroup(), enabling them to write more efficient and robust asynchronous code with Python 3.11.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
