It will transform how you write tests, especially for APIs. \n\n\rI made some contributions to it, which forever changed how I thought about `NotImplemented`. I thought it was a placeholder for unfinished work and unexpected use cases. I thought the language quirks it created in equality comparison were annoying. \n\n\rBut in **DirtyEquals**, it\u2019s a magic way to transform Python\u2019s built in equality operator... And that changed how I think about language quirks, full stop.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
