In this talk I will try to present caveats and gotchas that other Pythonists can find on their way while writing the asynchronous backend application using SQLAlchemy as an ORM. Mainly we will focus on how SQLAlchemy handles transactions and connections to the database and what issues we may face because of it.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
