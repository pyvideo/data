In this talk, I'll show you that \"logging\" is easy to learn and use, giving you far more flexibility than you can get from inserting calls to \"print\" all over your code. I'll show you how you can start to use \"logging\" right away -- but also how you can use it to create a sophisticated logging system that sends different types of output to different destinations. After this talk, you'll know how to use \"logging\", and you'll be less likely to use \"print\" in your applications.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
