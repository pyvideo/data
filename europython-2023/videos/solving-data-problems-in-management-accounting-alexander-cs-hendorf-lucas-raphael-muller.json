They have to check a lot of data from different sources. Often the reports contain erroneous or missing data. Identifying outliers and suspicious data is time-consuming. \n\n\rThis presentation will introduce a Small Data Problem-End2End workflow using statistical tools and machine learning to make controllers' jobs easier and help them be more productive.\n\n\rWe will demonstrate how we used amongst others, \n\r- [scipy](https://scipy.org/)\n\r- [pandera](https://pandera.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)\n\r- [dirty cat](https://dirty-cat.github.io/stable/)\n\r- [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/)\n\r- [fastnumbers](https://pypi.org/project/fastnumbers/)\n\rto create a self-improving system to automate the screening of reports and report outliers in advance so that they can be eliminated more quickly.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
