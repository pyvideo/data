There was a need to extract the data, make it meaningful and open to public, so we have come up with afetharita.com. The machine learning part of the application is completely based on open-source tools in Python and I will go through the pipeline and the process.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
