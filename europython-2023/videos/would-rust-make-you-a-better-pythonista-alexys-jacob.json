Illustrating a real story now in production at scale, I'll walk you through all the pains and joys of this unexpected journey which changed me more than I anticipated.\n\n\rProposed agenda:\n\r- Project introduction\n\r- Motivations of selecting this project to learn Rust\n\r- Tales of a Pythonista learning Rust\n\r- Results, numbers and production graphs\n\r- How Rust influences my daily Python\n\r- Was it worth it? Should you do it too?\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
