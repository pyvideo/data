  "description": "[EuroPython 2023 \u2014 Forum Hall on 2023-07-20]\n\rhttps://ep2023.europython.eu/session/music-information-retrieval-with-python\n\nThe advancements of artificial intelligence in computer vision and natural language processing often make the headlines, but the subspace of musical AI is developing just as rapidly. Let\u2019s take a dive into the research area of music information retrieval and see how Python enables some of its proudest achievements. You\u2019ll learn about common MIR tasks and get ideas on how you can analyze, generate and interact with music using code, so you can start exploring right away! \n\rNo music theory knowledge nor prior experience with MIR is expected.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
