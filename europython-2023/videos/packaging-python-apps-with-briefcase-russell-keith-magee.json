However, one area where it hasn't historically been popular is in building applications for end users.\n\n\rIn this talk, you'll discover how you can use Briefcase to distribute an app to users on desktop, mobile, and the web - all from a single Python codebase.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
