What will the future look like? Are we going to only talk to bots? Will prompting replace programming? Or are we just hyping up unreliable parrots and burning money? In this talk, I'll present visions for NLP in the age of LLMs and a pragmatic, practical approach for how to use Large Language Models to ship more successful NLP projects from prototype to production today.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
