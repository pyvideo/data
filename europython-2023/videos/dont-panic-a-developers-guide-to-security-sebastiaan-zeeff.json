At the same time, it can be difficult to know if what you\u2019re doing is enough. Luckily, you don\u2019t have to be a security expert to contribute to the security of your projects. Instead, you can use industry standards as a guide for your approach to security.\n\n\rIn this talk, I will introduce you to a framework that is especially accessible to developers, the [OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model](https://owasp.org/www-project-devsecops-maturity-model/), and help you get started with a systematic approach to improving the security of your projects.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
