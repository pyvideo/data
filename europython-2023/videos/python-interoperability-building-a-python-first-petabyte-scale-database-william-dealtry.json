With ArcticDB we have been doing exactly that for the last four years, by leveraging interoperability between Python and high-performance C++, with a detailed understanding of the data structures inside Python and a few extra tricks up our sleeves.\n\n\rCome take a peek under Python's bonnet and learn how to hotwire a few things along the way.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
