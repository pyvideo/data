  "description": "[EuroPython 2023 \u2014 South Hall 2B on 2023-07-19]\n\rhttps://ep2023.europython.eu/session/async-robots\n\nInteractive control of robots can be a challenge, as it requires a lot of things to happen in parallel while at the same time reacting to data from sensors and control signals. Using python's async facilities may greatly simplify this task, allowing us to write code that is similar to the non-parallel version, but that is at the same time easy to compose into bigger program doing many things at once. I will talk about my own experiences programming the Fluffbug robot with CircuitPython, point out the problems and the solutions I found.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
