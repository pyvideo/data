It does a lot of things for you: checks that your code has valid syntax and is properly indented, imports modules from various locations, and runs your code instruction-by-instruction.\n\n\rBut if you've ever wondered how exactly it happens, this talk will teach you the entire process, by building a working python interpreter from scratch.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
