We learnt from our mistake and we are introducing incompatible changes differently now. Document changes, provide a way to write code compatible with the old and the new way, tooling to ease the migration, design long term approach to reduce the need for incompatible changes.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
