Do you want to take your skills to the next level and achieve maximum performance while minimising memory usage? Look no further, here is Zero-Copy in Python!\n\rZero-copy is a technique in computer programming that allows data to be transferred between different parts of a program without being copied to intermediate buffers. In Python, this technique can be achieved using the memory view object, which provides a view into the memory of other objects. Learn how to efficiently manipulate large datasets and optimise your code with the help of this powerful tool. Whether you're working with sockets, objects or memory profiling, memory view is your key to faster and more efficient Python programming.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
