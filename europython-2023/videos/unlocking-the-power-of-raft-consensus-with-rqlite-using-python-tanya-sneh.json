Have you ever wondered how data integrity is maintained with the data across multiple nodes? One of the key components of achieving this is distributed consensus. Raft is a widely used consensus algorithm that provides a fault-tolerant and highly available system. In this talk, we will explore how to implement Raft consensus using the rqlite distributed database in python.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
