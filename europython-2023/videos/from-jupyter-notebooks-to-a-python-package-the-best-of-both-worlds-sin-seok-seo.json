However, we would feel \rdeficiencies in proper SW engineering supports at some point as the notebook grows to have larger and more complicated code. It is because the Jupyter notebook lacks several important features including code sharing, refactoring support, \rversion control and advanced editing. Fortunately, traditional full-fledged IDEs,\r such as _VS Code_ or _PyCharm,_ are available at hand and they support \rthese lacking features very well. \rThen, why don\u2019t we take advantage of the best of both worlds?\n\n\rIn this beginner-level hands-on talk, I will demonstrate how to \rtransform Jupyter notebook workflows to a proper Python package using _VS Code._ \rI will also introduce several basic but essential refactoring recommendations. By doing so, you can use the package for several notebooks \rand even share with your colleagues and friends.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
