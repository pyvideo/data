The traces lead him to the Vision-Language part of town, which has been a quiet and tranquil place with few incidents until lately. For a few months the neighbourhood has been growing extensively and careless benchmark leaders are dropping dead at an alarming rate.\n\n\rRobot Holmes sets out to find the cause for this new development and will gather intel on some of the most notorious of the new citizens of the Vision-Language neighbourhood and find out what makes them tick.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
