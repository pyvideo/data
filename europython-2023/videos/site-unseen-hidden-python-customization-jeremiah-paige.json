In some cases arbitrary python code can get executed before the first line of your module is reached. This is necessary for some of its dynamic nature, like virtualenvs but can also be harnessed to make the interpreter experience truly personal.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
