  "description": "How do you let untrained people in your company run sensitive processes on different remote servers? Processes that must run asynchronously and sequentially while accessing different common resources? And how do you do it quickly and make it robust? I will show how we used Django, SQS and Boto to create a distributed and decoupled solution that let users invoke services asynchronously, which is secure, scalable and ensures that processes using common resources ran in sequence.",
