  "description": "AMQP as standard application layer protocol is widely used to design backends where business logic is spread around different processes using a broker to link them, usually RabbitMQ. AMQP allows us to use different design patterns than the traditional monolithic backends, where part of your business logic is designed as entities of the AMQP topology.
