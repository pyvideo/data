Here in Brazil, the largest country in South America, we also have the biggest PyLadies community of the world (in number of chapters), with about 30 chapters around the country. But how did we get here? How do we manage to have such a huge group of people working together and specially learning from each other to run our activities so organically?\n\n\nFollow us\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pyconcolombia\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconcolombia\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/pyconcolombia/\nTelegram: https://t.me/pyconcolombia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pyco...\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/pyconco...\n\nMore About PyCon Colombia in http://www.pycon.co",
