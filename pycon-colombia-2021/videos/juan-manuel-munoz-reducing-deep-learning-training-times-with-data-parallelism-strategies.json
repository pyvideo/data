Wouldn’t you like your model to train about 4, 8 or even more times faster?\n\nDistributed training is a need when training state of the art deep learning models. Just to give an example, GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters and even with one good GPU it would take approximately 355 years to train.\n\nFollow us\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pyconcolombia\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconcolombia\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/pyconcolombia/\nTelegram: https://t.me/pyconcolombia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pycon-colombia/\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/pyconcolombia/\n\nMore About PyCon Colombia in http://www.pycon.co",
