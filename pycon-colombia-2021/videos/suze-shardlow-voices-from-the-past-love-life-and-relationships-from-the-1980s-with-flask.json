In the 1980s, we faced a different pandemic: the AIDS crisis. Some 30 years ago, a group of researchers interviewed young women in London and Manchester, UK, about aspects of their lives and how they felt about love and relationships. The voices of these women exist on audio cassette tapes and transcripts recorded at the time and, now, these voices from the past meet us in the present via a chatbot powered by Flask.\"\n\n\nFollow us\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pyconcolombia\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconcolombia\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/pyconcolombia/\nTelegram: https://t.me/pyconcolombia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pyco...\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/pyconco...\n\nMore About PyCon Colombia in http://www.pycon.co",
