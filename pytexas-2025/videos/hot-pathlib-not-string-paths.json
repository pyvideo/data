  "description": "Have you seen pathlib? If not, once I show you, you will never go back to string paths and os.path ever again! pathlib turns paths into path objects, which have attributes and methods that cover a number of operations. In this talk, we will:\n\n* Talk about how to create Path objects, and how this differs on Windows vs Mac/Linux\n* Talk about the many properties of pure paths\n* Talk about folder operations from Path objects, such as creating directory structures and recursive globbing.\n* Talk about file operations, made simpler with Path objects, such as reading contents, getting properties like file size, and deleting.\n\nStop messing with string paths and get with pathlib!",
