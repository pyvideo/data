  "description": "SQLAlchemy simplifies SQL model creation and manipulation using Python. However, efficient data transmission requires serialization of Python objects for network interactions and database storage. Serialization transforms data for transmission and storage, which are crucial in database procedures. In this talk, we will explore configurable (de)serialization tools to enhance SQLAlchemy ORM model's capabilities, their advanced use cases, and implementation. We will also compare this to the features of commonly-used serializer alternatives, such as SerializerMixin, Marshmallow-SQLAlchemy, ColanderAlchemy, Serialchemy, SQLAthanor, and more.",
