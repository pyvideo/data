  "description": "Python's increasingly powerful type annotations (and the type checkers and IDEs that consume them) are a great way to manage the complexities of Python GUI programming. This talk will walk through a strictly typed PyQt/PySide GUI application skeleton while touching on custom logging handlers, enum-based error passing, type-aware match statements, and how generic types empower function decorators, decorator factories, and class decorators.",
