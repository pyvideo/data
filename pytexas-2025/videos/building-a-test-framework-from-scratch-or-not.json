  "description": "pytest is a fantastic test framework, but why use it when you can just build your own test framework from scratch? Sounds wild, right? Well, it is! In this talk, we will learn what testing in Python is all about by iteratively building features of a framework from the ground up. Through this, we will learn not just what goes into a test framework but why those features are there - the runner, the structure, the assertions, and more. We will develop a deep understanding of how test frameworks work and also how to write good tests with them. We will also gain immense appreciation for mature test frameworks like pytest that save our time by providing off-the-shelf testing features that deliver serious value.",
