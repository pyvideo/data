  "description": "Async is often about tackling IO-bound, high concurrency work, but it can also be about long running, interruptible work. While we frequently think about generators in the context of iterators, generators are a great fit in any scenario where the function needs to be interruptible and resumable. In this talk, weâ€™ll take a fresh look at generators and look at how we used them to build a durable orchestration framework.",
