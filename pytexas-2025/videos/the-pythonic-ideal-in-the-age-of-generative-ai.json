  "description": "The advent of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) programs, such as ChatGPT, and code pair programming tools, such as GitHub Copilot, has ushered in concerns about whether or not it is still valuable to learn to write code, or to continue to improve our ability to write idiomatic, beautiful code. The reality is that generative AI programs can write code that is poor quality or incorrect. In addition, generative AI is still in its infancy and cannot yet replace human innovation or innate expertise for complex tasks, such as writing Pythonic code. Do we need to be worried about AI taking over coding jobs? This talk will cover why learning to write Pythonic code is still a valuable skill to pursue, and will introduce techniques to add generative AI and pair programming AI tools into your teaching (and learning!).",
