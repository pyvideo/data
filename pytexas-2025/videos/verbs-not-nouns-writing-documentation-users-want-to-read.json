  "description": "Lots of documentation is dull and tough to read. That's because most documentation focuses on describing product features, and those are nouns. Your user's primary concern isn't what your product is, or how it's made. Your user has a problem they want to solve, and they want to know how to use your product to do that. They're looking for a verb. In this talk, you'll find the verbs that go with your nouns, and how that translates into readable documentation.",
