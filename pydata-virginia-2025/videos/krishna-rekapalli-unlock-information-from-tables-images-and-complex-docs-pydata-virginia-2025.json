This hands-on tutorial will guide participants through building a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Docling, an open-source document processing library.\n\nParticipants will learn how to harness Docling's advanced capabilities to build superior RAG systems that can understand and retrieve information from complex document elements that traditional tools might miss. Participants will learn how to handle complex documents, extract structured information, and create an efficient vector database for semantic search. The session will cover best practices for document parsing, chunking strategies, and integration with popular LLM frameworks.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
