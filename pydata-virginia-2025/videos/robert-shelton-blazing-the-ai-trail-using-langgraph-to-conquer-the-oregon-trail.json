This hands-on workshop will guide data scientists and engineers through building a complete workflow using LangGraph, and will show how to define custom tools, implement vector retrieval, leverage semantic caching, incorporate allow/block list routing, and structure model output for downstream consumption. In order to participate, attendees will need to have Python (3.11 or later), docker, an OpenAI api key, and the starter code for the project cloned.\n\nStarter code: https://github.com/redis-developer/agents-redis-lang-graph-workshop\n\nNote: participants can test their environment setup ahead of time by following the Readme and running python test_setup.py before the workshop.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
