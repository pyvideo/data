The Apache Arrow project offers a standardized solution to reduce these integration challenges.\n\nWill Ayd (Apache Arrow Committer and pandas maintainer) and Matt Topol (Apache Arrow PMC Member and author of \"In Memory Analytics with Apache Arrow\") will discuss how Apache Arrow is changing the data landscape. A brief overview of Arrow standards will be provided, while also reviewing real world implementations of where the Arrow specification has driven down the cost of data interoperability.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
