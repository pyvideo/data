  "description": "Data system interoperability remains a significant challenge in open source ecosystems, with high costs in development time and resources when moving data across complex infrastructures. The Apache Arrow project offers a standardized solution to reduce these integration challenges.\n\nWill Ayd (Apache Arrow Committer and pandas maintainer) and Matt Topol (Apache Arrow PMC Member and author of \"In Memory Analytics with Apache Arrow\") will discuss how Apache Arrow is changing the data landscape. A brief overview of Arrow standards will be provided, while also reviewing real world implementations of where the Arrow specification has driven down the cost of data interoperability.",
