This transition necessitates a profound understanding of organizational goals, data governance, and ethical considerations. By aligning AI initiatives with business objectives, fostering cross-functional collaboration, and addressing challenges such as data privacy and employee adaptation, AI professionals can drive effective transformation. This keynote explores the essential competencies and approaches required for AI practitioners to lead their organizations successfully into an AI-centric future.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization.
