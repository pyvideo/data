Variational Inference (VI) offers a scalable alternative, trading exactness for speed while retaining the essence of Bayesian inference.\n\nIn this tutorial, we\u2019ll explore how to implement and compare VI techniques in PyMC, including the Adaptive Divergence Variational Inference (ADVI) and the cutting-edge Pathfinder algorithm.\n\nStarting with simple models like linear regression, we\u2019ll gradually introduce more complex, real-world applications, comparing the performance of VI against Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to understand the trade-offs in speed and accuracy.\n\nThis tutorial will arm participants with practical tools to deploy VI in their workflows and help answer pressing questions, like \"What do I do when MCMC is too slow?\", or \"How does VI compare to MCMC in terms of approximation quality?\".\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
