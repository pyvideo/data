Hence, Graphs are very useful for modeling and solving a wide variety of real-world problems.\n\nWhile NetworkX is amazing for getting started with Graphs, the library encounters bottlenecks in performance at scale.\n\nIs there a solution out there for users who want more performance from NX and also Open-Source developers who want to implement fast algorithms? Yes! Thanks to the magic of dispatching.\n\nNetworkX now supports dispatching to various backends, including the GPU accelerated cuGraph library by Nvidia RAPIDS.\n\nAttend this talk to learn about how you can use nx-cugraph \u2013 the cuGraph-powered backend for NetworkX \u2013 and how it unlocks exciting new possibilities for you to solve real-world graph analytics problems.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
