  "description": "Graphs are a fundamental form of storing data. This is because everything is connected! Hence, Graphs are very useful for modeling and solving a wide variety of real-world problems.\n\nWhile NetworkX is amazing for getting started with Graphs, the library encounters bottlenecks in performance at scale.\n\nIs there a solution out there for users who want more performance from NX and also Open-Source developers who want to implement fast algorithms? Yes! Thanks to the magic of dispatching.\n\nNetworkX now supports dispatching to various backends, including the GPU accelerated cuGraph library by Nvidia RAPIDS.\n\nAttend this talk to learn about how you can use nx-cugraph \u2013 the cuGraph-powered backend for NetworkX \u2013 and how it unlocks exciting new possibilities for you to solve real-world graph analytics problems.",
