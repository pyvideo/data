There is widespread interest in using administrative data -- information collected by government and agencies in the implementation of public programs -- to evaluate systems and promote most just outcomes. Working with the Civil Court Data Initiative of Legal Services Corporation, we use data collected from civil court records in Virginia to analyze the behavior of landlords. Expanding on our Virginia Evictors Catalog, we use data on court evictions to build additional data tools to support the work of legal and housing advocates and model key eviction outcomes to contribute to our understanding of landlord behavior.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
