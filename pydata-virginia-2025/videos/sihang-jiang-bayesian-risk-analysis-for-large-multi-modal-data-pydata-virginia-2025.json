  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nIn the era of big data, multi-modal data from multiple sources or modalities has become increasingly prevalent in various fields such as healthcare. The National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) provides researchers with abundant clinical data in different forms by aggregating and harmonizing Electronic Health Records (EHR) data across different clinical organizations in the United States, making it convenient for researchers to analyze COVID-related topics and build models with large multimodal data. Bayesian risk analysis has advantages in handling the complexities and heterogeneities of multi-modal healthcare data, specifically in cohort studies when researchers try to answer questions of interest in public health or medicine field regarding COVID and Long COVID.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
