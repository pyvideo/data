  "description": "Tired of waiting for massive datasets to load on your local machine? In this beginner-friendly tutorial, we\u2019ll explore how to scale your data analysis skills from pandas to PySpark using a real-world anime dataset. We\u2019ll walk through the basics of distributed computing, discuss why Spark was created, and demonstrate the benefits of working with PySpark for big data tasks\u2014including reading, cleaning, and transforming millions of records with ease. By the end of this workshop, you\u2019ll understand how PySpark harnesses cluster computing to handle large-scale data and you\u2019ll be comfortable applying these techniques to your own projects.\n\nParticipant Requirements:\n- A laptop (any OS) with an internet connection\n- A Google account (to access Colab notebooks and slides)\n- Familiarity with Python and pandas\n\nHere's the link to the Google Colab to follow along \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe\nhttps://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fi0cTQ1NIE5kDEH0ynp2sqDuVeiBJJWU?usp=sharing\n\nHere are the slides \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/11JIih1VzLxTJ9O6PeGzqD_e8vumTZQmw/view?usp=sharing",
