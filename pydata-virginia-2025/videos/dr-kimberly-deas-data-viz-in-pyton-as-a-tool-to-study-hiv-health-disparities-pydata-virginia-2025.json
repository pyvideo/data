This webinar will demonstrate how Python can serve as a powerful tool for creating data visualizations that illustrate the unequal burden of HIV across different populations. Participants will learn how Python\u2019s popular libraries, such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, can transform complex datasets into accessible, impactful visuals.\nUsing an HIV dataset containing demographic, geographic, and clinical variables, this session will guide attendees through a series of practical examples. From creating heatmaps and geospatial maps to analyzing temporal trends, the webinar emphasizes how to identify and communicate key social determinants related to race, gender, socioeconomic status, and access to care. Through hands-on demonstrations, attendees will see how Python\u2019s capabilities streamline data analysis and visualization workflows.\nKey takeaways from the session include identifying regions and communities in Texas, disproportionately affected by HIV, uncovering intersectional factors influencing health outcomes, and leveraging visual tools to inform policy and resource allocation. Special attention will be given to designing visuals that resonate with non-technical audiences, ensuring findings are actionable for public health professionals and policymakers.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
