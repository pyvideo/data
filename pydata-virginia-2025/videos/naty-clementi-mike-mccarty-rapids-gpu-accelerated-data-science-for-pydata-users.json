  "description": "In this introductory hands-on tutorial, participants will learn how to accelerate their data workflows with RAPIDS (https://rapids.ai/), an open-source suite of libraries designed to leverage the power of NVIDIA (https://www.nvidia.com/) GPUs for end-to-end data pipelines. Using familiar PyData APIs like cuDF (GPU-accelerated pandas) and cuML (GPU-accelerated machine learning), attendees will explore how to seamlessly integrate these tools into their existing workflows with minimal code changes, achieving significant speedups in tasks such as data processing and model training.",
