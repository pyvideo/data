And how can you use the power of AI agents in your day-to-day data science workflow? In this hands-on tutorial, I will introduce AI agents and demonstrate how to design, build, and manage a multi-agent system for your data science workflows. Participants will learn how to break down complex tasks, assign AI agents to collaborate effectively, and ensure accuracy and reliability in their outputs. We will also discuss the trade-offs, limitations, and best practices for incorporating AI agents into data science projects.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
