  "description": "In our project, we took MRI-derived brain data and reinterpreted it through an aesthetic lens. Using multidimensional scaling (MDS) to distill complex patterns in cortical anatomy, we transformed these insights into physical 3D-printed brain models. Each sculpture serves as a tangible narrative, celebrating both the subtle and striking differences between male and female brains, whether neurotypical or affected by ASD.",
