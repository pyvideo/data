    "description": "Python 3's `str` was a leap forward but not a panacea. Join me to dive into the strange world of unicode, how it can bite you, and what to do about it.\n\nIn Python 3 we finally got a Unicode-native `str` type throughout, and there was much rejoicing. But Unicode is a tricky beast, difficult to tame, and there are still plenty of ways it can bite you if you are not careful.\n\nWe will look at some of these ways, the eldritch abominations looming in shadowy corners of Python's text; we will discover how the siren-song of seemingly innocuous strings can dash you upon the rocks, the deep peculiarity of the humble flag, and finally come to inner peace and harmony as we understand true grapheme-nature.\n\nWe will then touch on the deeper mysteries of bidirectional text, and our hearts will turn to despair. It will be a fun time.",
