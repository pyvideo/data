Look no further than the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).\n\nDo you find it difficult to keep up with the increasing number of reported vulnerabilities? Are you unclear about the severity of a vulnerability in your system? Look no further than the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). \nThis standardized framework provides an objective method for scoring security vulnerabilities on a scale from 0 to 10, enabling you to prioritize resources and improve your system's security and resilience. Our talk will demonstrate how to utilize CVSS in Python projects, enabling you to efficiently prioritize efforts and set up automated vulnerability reports. Don't let vulnerabilities go unnoticed - utilize CVSS to enhance your software security today.",
