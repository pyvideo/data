    "description": "Technology is often hidden backstage at the theatre \u2013 a toolkit to enhance performance, not something artists make plays about. But generations of audience members have \u2018grown up online\u2019. To tell contemporary stories, don\u2019t we need to put tech centre stage? What is digital theatre \u2013 and is it still theatre?\n\nAda Lovelace was the daughter of a social reformer and a mad/bad/dangerous-to-know poet. She grew up to be a mathematician, an analyst, a musician, a gambler, and the first computer programmer. But the engine she coded for was never built \u2013 and she didn\u2019t live to see whether her programme worked or not. \n\nI\u2019m the daughter of an English tutor and a \u2018works in software\u2019. I\u2019ve grown up to be a playwright and a digital theatre-maker. I was also commissioned to research, write, and develop a play about Ada Lovelace, music, AI, and poetical science. But it was never staged \u2013 and I have no idea if it works in performance or not.  \n\nLuckily I\u2019m not dead yet, and I have actually managed to stage other work exploring how tech-y themes, online communities, and virtual spaces work in live theatre. My theatre-making overlaps with gaming, radio, film, and livestreaming. I love thinking about how staging the tech can create restrictions/opportunities, feeding into the form and the theme of a story. And I\u2019m especially interested in how theatre \u2013 an artform that had to change dramatically to survive lockdown \u2013 might move forwards now that audiences are more reluctant to leave their homes than ever.\n\nIf you\u2019re not the kind of person who goes to the theatre then you might be the kind of person who\u2019s up for digital theatre \u2013 poetical science, maybe, rather than just poetry. If, of course, we can agree on what digital theatre even is\u2026",
