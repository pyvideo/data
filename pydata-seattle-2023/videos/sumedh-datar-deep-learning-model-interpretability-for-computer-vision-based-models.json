  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nApplied Deep Learning to computer vision has become very popular in the last decade. Many real-world problems related to detection and recognition are being solved by using popular open-source models. Many problems are very specific and off-the-shelf models do not work as it is. These models have to be trained with custom data to perform specific tasks. While training these models apart from empirical information related to training performance, there s no way to interpret the results from the deep learning models. In this talk, I will talk about various ways that we can use to interpret results visually for deep learning models.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
