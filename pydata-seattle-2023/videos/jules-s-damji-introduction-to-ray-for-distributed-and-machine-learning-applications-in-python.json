This tutorial includes a brief talk to give an overview of concepts, why and what Ray is, and how you write distributed Python applications and scale machine learning workloads.\n\nSetup instructions for your laptop\nTo avoid wasting time doing it in class, please set up your laptops before coming to class.\nIf you want to follow along and have hands-on experience, please follow instructions on\nhow to set up your laptop with Ray.\nhttps://github.com/dmatrix/ray-core-tutorial#-setup-instructions-for-local-laptop-\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
