It probably speaks SQL, because SQL is ubiquitous, it\u2019s been around for a while, it\u2019s standardized, and it\u2019s concise.\nBut is it really standardized? And is it always concise? No!\n\nDo we still need to use it? Probably!\n\nWhat\u2019s a data-person to do? String-templated SQL?\nprint(f\u201dThat way lies {{ m\u0334\u030f\u0301\u0355\u0330\u0345\u033ba\u0338\u0351\u031f\u031c\u0349d\u0335\u0311\u0328\u032bn\u0335\u0312\u0351\u033e\u0316\u0332e\u0338\u034c\u0318\u033c\u032ds\u0335\u033d\u0347\u0316\u031cs\u0338\u0357\u034c\u030f\u030a\u0332\u035c\u0322\u0316 }}\u201d.)\n\nInstead, come and learn about Ibis! It offers a dataframe-like interface to construct concise and composable queries and then executes them against a wide variety of backends (Postgres, DuckDB, Spark, Snowflake, BigQuery, you name it.).\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
