  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nAutoGluon is an open source AutoML framework, developed by AWS. It can train models on multimodal image-text-tabular data with a few lines of code, producing a powerful multi-layer stack ensemble of transformer image models, BERT language models, and a suite of tabular models all working in tandem. This tutorial will give an overview of AutoGluon followed by a deep dive into how (and why) it has proven to be so effective, and finish with code examples to demonstrate how you can revolutionize your ML workflow.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
