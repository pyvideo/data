  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nAltair is a popular Python visualization library that makes it easy to build a wide variety of statistical charts. On its own, Altair is unsuitable for visualizing large datasets (more than a few thousand rows) because it requires transferring the entire dataset to the browser for data processing and rendering. VegaFusion integrates with Altair to overcome this limitation by automatically moving data intensive calculations from the browser to the Python kernel. With VegaFusion, many Altair charts easily scale to millions of rows, significantly increasing the utility of Altair throughout the PyData ecosystem.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
