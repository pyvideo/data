  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nShiny is a web framework that is designed to let you create data dashboards, interactive visualizations, and workflow apps in pure Python or R. Shiny doesn't require knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and lets you create data-centric applications in a fraction of the time and effort of traditional web stacks.\n\nOf course, Python already has several popular and high-quality options for creating data-centric web applications. So it's fair to ask what Shiny can offer the Python community.\n\nIn this talk, I will introduce Shiny for Python and answer that question. I'll start with some basic demos that show how Shiny apps are constructed. Next, I'll explain Transparent Reactive Programming (TRP), which is the animating concept behind Shiny, and the reason it occupies such an interesting place on the ease-vs-power tradeoff frontier. Finally, I'll wrap up with additional demos that feature interesting functionality that is made trivial with TRP.\n\nThis talk should be interesting to anyone who uses Python to analyze or visualize data, and does not require experience with Shiny or any other web frameworks.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
