  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nJupyter AI is a new open source Jupyter extension that enables end users to perform a wide range of common tasks using generative AI models in JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, and IPython. Jupyter AI provides an IPython magic interface that allows users to easily experiment with multiple models and leverage them inside of notebooks to debug failing cells, generate code, and answer questions. In a notebook context, Jupyter AI magics offer users two additional features: 1) a reproducible and shareable artifact for model invocation, and 2) a visual experience for exploring model output in different formats such as Markdown, LaTeX, JSON, image formats, and more. Jupyter AI also provides a chat UI through a JupyterLab extension that allows users to interact with a model conversationally. The chat UI also allows users to include selections with the prompt, or replace selections with generated output. Furthermore, Jupyter AI is vendor-neutral and supports models from AI21, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, Cohere, OpenAI, and more right out-of-the-box. Jupyter AI fills a need for a modular and extensible framework for integrating AI models into Jupyter.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
