It frequently involves iterating over multiple models on a smaller scale and then converting those models to run at scale. In this talk we will discuss the inefficiencies of this process and present a modern open source based solution that helps to mitigate many of these inefficiencies. The proposed tools and approaches help data scientists, data engineers, and machine learning engineers work more efficiently across all ranges of tasks and reduce the time-to-solution. We also present future development plans.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
