  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nThere is a pressing need for tools and workflows that meet data scientists where they are: how to enable an organization of data scientists, who may not have formal training as software engineers, to build and deploy end-to-end machine learning workflows and applications independently.\n\nWe wanted to provide the best possible user experience for data scientists, allowing them to focus on the parts of the ML stack where they can deliver the most value (such as modeling using their favorite off-the-shelf libraries) while providing secure & robust built-in solutions for the underlying infrastructure (including data, compute, orchestration, and versioning). In this talk, we discuss the problem space, our enterprise-scale challenges at Dell, and the approach we took to solving it with Metaflow, the open-source ML platform developed at Netflix, & Outerbounds.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
