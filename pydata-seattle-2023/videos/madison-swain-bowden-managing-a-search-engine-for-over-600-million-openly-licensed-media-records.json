Or wanted to remix a song? Create some art using images with the express consent of the original creator? Openverse (wp.org/openverse and openverse.org) is a search engine for openly licensed media with over 600 million indexed image & audio files. Openverse can help you find this content, and give appropriate attribution for it. Managing this much data from over 30 disparate sources can be a challenge. We'll talk about how we identify, aggregate, and index CC licensed data across the web to make it accessible from a single search engine.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
