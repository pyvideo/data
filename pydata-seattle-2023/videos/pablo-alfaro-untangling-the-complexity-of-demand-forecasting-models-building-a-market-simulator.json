In this talk, we will discuss our modeling choices for both the demand and the market. We will also share how developing a simulator can help understand how models learn and adapt to changing realities and conditions.\n\nThe demand simulator has been essential in our efforts to continuously improve our strategies and provide the best demand forecasting models. Staying competitive in a tough market requires conducting research, and we hope to inspire others by showing what can be achieved.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
