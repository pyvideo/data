Observability not only helps understand a ML model better, it removes uncertainty and speculation giving a deeper insight into some of the overlooked aspects during model development. It helps to answer the \"why\" narrative behind an observed outcome. In this tutorial, we will build a production quality Model Observability pipeline with open source python stack. ML engineers, Data scientists and Researchers can use this framework to further extend and develop a comprehensive Model Observability platform\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
