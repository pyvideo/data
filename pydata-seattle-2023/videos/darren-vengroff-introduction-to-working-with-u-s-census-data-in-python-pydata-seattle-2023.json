These are useful across a myriad of fields including data journalism, allocation of public and private resources, data activism, marketing and strategic planning across many sectors.\n\nIn this tutorial, which is targeted at both beginners and those with some experience with census data, we will demonstrate how open-source Python tools can be used to discover, download, analyze, and generate maps of U.S. Census data.\n\nThis tutorial will consider the full breadth and richness of data available from the U.S. Census. We will cover not only American Community Survey (ACS) and similarly well-known data sets, but also a number of data sets that are less well-known but nonetheless useful in a variety of research contexts.\n\nThrough a series of hands-on demonstrations, attendees will learn to\n\u2022 discover data sets, some with a handful of variables and others\nwith tens of thousands;\n\u2022 download demographic and economic indicators at levels ranging from the entire nation to individual neighborhoods;\n\u2022 plot the data we downloaded on maps; \n\nAll Python tooling used in the workshop is available as open-source\nsoftware. Final versions of the notebooks used in the tutorial will also\nbe made available via open-source.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
