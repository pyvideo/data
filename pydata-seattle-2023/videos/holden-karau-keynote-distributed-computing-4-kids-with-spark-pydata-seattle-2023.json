  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nDistributed Computing is a lot of fun, so why don't we share it with our kids? Are you tired of kind of \"hand waving\" explanations of what you've been doing at work? In this talk we'll explore how to teach children about distributed computing (mostly data parallel) along with a little bit of Spark. We'll then talk about how we'll expand to teaching concepts like \"actors\" and \"non-data-parallelism\" to children. You don't need to have kids to enjoy this talk!\n\nCome for the gnome filled slides, stay for the thinking about how to explain your work to people outside of your field.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
