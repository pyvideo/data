Traditionally, you would write your extensions in C/C++. Rust offers an alternative to C/C++ with these benefits:\n\n\u2022 As fast as C/C++\n\u2022 Much better memory safety and security than C/C++\n\u2022 Most loved programming language since 2016\n\u2022 Multithreading without needing a runtime\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll cover nine rules that I learned as I ported our open-source genomics extension from C++ to Rust. This will help you get started and help you organize your project.\n\nIf you\u2019re a seasoned extension writer frustrated with C/C++, or a beginner looking to write your first extension, this talk is for you!\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
