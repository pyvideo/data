  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nOver the last decade, we have seen innumerable advancements in the scientific community due to the shift toward collaborative, open science. We've learned, as a community, we must work together in order to build the next generation of scientific innovation. The history of the scientific computing ecosystem is intricately tied to its open source initiatives. One cannot succeed without the other. In this talk, we'll review how the NumFOCUS organization contributes to the support, sustainability, and diversity of a vibrant scientific open source community. We will walk you through where we've been, where we are going, and the lessons we've learned along the way.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
