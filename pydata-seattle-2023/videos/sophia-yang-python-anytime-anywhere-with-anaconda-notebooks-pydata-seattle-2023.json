Cloud notebook services in general enable you to start coding in Python immediately\u2014anytime and anywhere you have an internet connection. Don\u2019t worry about setting up environments; with cloud notebooks, you can get started without any installation. Spin up your awesome data science projects directly from your browser with all the packages and computing power you need.\n\nIn this talk, I\u2019ll show you how to use Anaconda Notebooks to quickly get started with Python in the cloud. Anaconda Notebooks is a managed Jupyter notebook service that enables you to quickly get coding anywhere without installing anything. Empowered by Intake, a data catalog library, Anaconda Notebooks offers a simple and consistent user interface for loading data, regardless of its format or location. All the data knowledge is consolidated in one place! What\u2019s more? Pre-loaded with HvPlot, Panel, and many other data science packages, Anaconda Notebooks allows you to deploy your data visualization dashboards or data apps with only a few lines of code.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
