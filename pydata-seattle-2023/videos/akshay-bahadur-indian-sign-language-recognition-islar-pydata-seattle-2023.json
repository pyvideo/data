Even stranger is the fact that their sign languages are also distinct, having some very varied signs for the same objects/expressions/phrases. While regional diversification in spoken languages and scripts are well known and widely documented, apparently, this has percolated in sign language as well, essentially resulting in multiple sign languages across the country. To help overcome these inconsistencies and to standardize sign language in India, I am collaborating with the Centre for Research and Development of Deaf & Mute (an NGO in Pune) and Google. Adopting a two-pronged approach: a) I have developed an Indian Sign Language Recognition System (ISLAR) which utilizes Artificial Intelligence to accurately identify signs and translate them into text/vocals in real-time, and b) have proposed standardization of sign languages across India to the Government of India and the Indian Sign Language Research and Training Centre.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
