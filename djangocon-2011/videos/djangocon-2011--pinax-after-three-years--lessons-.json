  "description": "Pinax after three years: Lessons learnt and the way forward\n\nPresented by James Tauber\n\nThe Pinax platform has had its ups and downs since it was launched in\n2008. People either love it or just don't get it. About the only thing\neveryone agrees on is that it doesn't seem to be progressing as fast as\nit once did. This talk will take a fresh look at the goals of Pinax,\nwhat we did well, what we didn't do so well and what we're (slowly)\ndoing to fix it.\n",
