  "description": "Safely deploying on the cutting edge\n\nEric Holscher\n\nThis talk will go through the deployment system that we have built at\nUrban Airship. It will cover the process that allows us to automate our\ndeployments, making it safe to deploy at any time. It's built on Fabric,\nGunicorn, Virtualenv, Rsync, Supervisord, and Python. We end up with\nfully isolated environments for our services that are easy to manage.\n",
