  "description": "Taking the robot out of Mr. Robot or: Why tech sucks & how you can help to make it better\n\nKerstin Kollmann\n\nNot everything about the tech industry is as \"cool\" as it is sometimes made out to be \u2013 by the media, representations in fiction or indeed members of the tech community themselves \u2013 though not everyone is equally aware of how or why it is more difficult \"to tech\" for some than it is for others, regardless of innate talent or skills.\n\nIn my talk I want to point out some of the barriers which make it harder or less fun for some of us to participate and how everyone can contribute to making tech a little more welcoming for everyone else. (& I might use examples from your new favourite fictional texts while I'm at it.)",
