  "description": "Captivating a group of children for a sustained period of time is\nnotoriously hard. I will be exporing with you how the micro:bit can be\nused to engage a young audience with interactive demos and programming\nactivities.\n\nChildren love to physically interact with hardware. That is what is\ngreat about the micro:bit. It not only has built in LEDs and buttons but\ncan also control bigger more exciting electronics like robotic arms.\nThis allows for setup that gives students of all ability levels a\nchallenge. Students that are beginners to programming can be given a\nmore complete program or walk throught a worksheet that takes them\nthrough the process of controling the device (in this case a robotic\narm) step by step. Students that have higher programming skills can be\ngiven a more bare bones / boilerplate source file and can write code to\ncontrol the arm with less guidance.\n",
