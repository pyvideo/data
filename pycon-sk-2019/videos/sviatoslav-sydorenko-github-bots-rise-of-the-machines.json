This workshop will\nempower you to automate all the things using GitHub Apps integration\ntype as reusable restless workers helping you overcome typical\nmaintainer frustrations. We'll have a walkthrough of the complete\napplication creation and deployment process: from creating an App entity\nin the GitHub UI, to actual coding and to shipping your code via Heroku.\n\nTo participate in the hands-on, bring your laptop with Python 3.7 and\nsome editor on-board. You'll also need to have a GitHub account.\n\nBonus: `sign up for GitHub\nActions <https://github.com/features/actions/signup>`__ as early as\npossible to try it out on the workshop.\n\nAgenda:\n\n\n",
