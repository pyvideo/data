  "description": "Building for the modern web is complicated and error-prone: a typical\nweb app requires five different languages and four or five frameworks\njust to get started. Wouldn't it be nicer if we could do it all in\nPython? With Anvil, you can design your page visually, write your\nbrowser-side and server-side code in pure Python, and even set up a\nbuilt-in database in seconds. In this talk, Meredydd will walk us\nthrough how Anvil works under the bonnet, and the challenges of building\na programming system that's easy to use without sacrificing power.\n",
