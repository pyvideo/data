  "description": "MVP: Minimum Viable Product. We all follow agile product development\nprocess, iterate fast, fail fast and in the disguise of a MVP we cut\ncorners to release a product to the market ASAP. In this process, their\nare several compromises we make in the tech set up and the codebase to\njust get it out there. These compromises more often than not always\nbites us back.\n\nAnd this is what the talk is about. The assumptions which never hold,\nthe implementation which is never revisited, and the MVP which never\nends up being just a MVP. By the end of talk, you would know the\ncautionary tale of the most common mistakes everyone makes while\ndeveloping a new product and some measures on how you can avoid them.\n",
