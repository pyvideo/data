  "description": "This talk is structured into two parts of approximately equal length:\n\nFirst an introduction to blockchains in general. Most have heard about\nblockchains or bitcoin but how does it actually work and what is the\ntechnology driving it? This talk will explain what a cryptocurrency\nwallet is, how transactions are created and how they are brought\ntogether to form blocks that build the blockchain. I will outline\ndifferences between the most widely used implementations and the core\ntechnological concepts behind them, like Proof-of-Work versus\nProof-of-Stake, consensus algorithms, trustless systems and the ideas\nbehind them.\n\nIn the second half of the talk I draw on my experience working with\npython in my professional career and give an overview of the python\necosystem for blockhain and cryptocurrency development. I will showcase\nsome of the libraries and tools that exist, like btcpy and highlight\nsome of the pros and cons (mostly pros) of using python in this sector.\n",
