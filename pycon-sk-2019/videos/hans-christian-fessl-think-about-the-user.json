  "description": "As developers, we are mainly focused on making things work. Business\nlogic and process analysis, reinventing the wheel and questioning every\nline of code are what we do best. But when it comes to making this very\ncomplex systems work for users, we are quickly frustrated, because it\nfeels like they just don't get it. As people of code, we are no longer\nregular users because we understand what is going on behind the curtains\nof the big show that is called a User Interface. What means, that by\ndefault, users have a totally different experience then we developers\ndo. In this talk, I want to extend my lightning talk from last year to\nhalf an hour, to give you some tips on how to get a users perspective on\nthe user interface you want or have to create.\n",
