  "description": "Not everybody has a chance to work on new project from scratch.\nEverybody has some ideas what to do for such a project so it'll be a\ngood one instead of legacy in a near future. During this talk I want to\nshare my experience and show what works for me. I'll start from project\nanalysis and end on deployment and beyond. I want to discuss some common\nmistakes and misconceptions and hopefully give you some ideas you could\nuse for your own project regardless of its size. With a bit of work\nsome/all could be applied to legacy projects as well.\n",
