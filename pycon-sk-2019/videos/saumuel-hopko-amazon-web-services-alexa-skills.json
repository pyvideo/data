  "description": "Alexa is Amazon\u2019s cloud base voice service that provides natural voice\nexperience to end users. This opens a way to use human voice as\ninput/output for you applications. You can easily create\nvoice-controlled applications (called Alexa skills) or just voice\ninterface for your current products or anything you like! Tools provided\nby Amazon web services (AWS) are easy to use and if used correctly, then\ncompletely free. Once skill is done, it\u2019s just a matter of minutes to\ndeploy it as high-available, auto-scaled, serverless, globally\ndistributed application using AWS. Then you can use Amazon Alexa Skill\nstore to sell your product all over the world. I would like to show you\nhow it works, what AWS provides to developers and how can anybody create\nAlexa skills using your favorite language \u2013 Python.\n",
