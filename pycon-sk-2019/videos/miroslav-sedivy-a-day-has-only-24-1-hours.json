  "description": "Not only will the Sunday in the week after this PyCon.SK 2019 be one\nhour shorter, but also it may steal you even more sleep because of all\nyour Python code that has to work smoothly during daylight saving time\nchanges or otherwise manipulate time zones. While correct working with\ndatetime objects and offsets can be mastered, you have no control of the\ninformation on local time zones. Exclusive domain of geographers one\nhundred years ago, the time zones adjustments became a toy in the hands\nof governments all around the world.\n\nAfter a short overview of Pythons datetime and pytz libraries you'll\nlearn how the information on time zone changes gets into your system.\nWe'll fly quickly around the world's over five hundred time zones, but\nwill also focus on the case of Slovakia and surrounding countries. Two\ncenturies of propaganda and chaos in thirty minutes. Maybe that will\nmake you want to avoid time zones in your code altogether!\n",
