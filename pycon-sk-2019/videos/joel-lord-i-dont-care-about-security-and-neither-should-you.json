  "description": "Remember when setting up a login page was easy? It seems like nowadays\nit can take weeks to start a project -- creating a signup form, a login\nform, a password recovery screen, and all the validation in between. And\nyou haven't even started on security considerations yet. During this\npresentation, the attendees will be introduced to OpenID Connect and\nOAuth. They will also learn how to leverage these technologies to create\nmore secure applications. Most importantly, they will learn how to\ndelegate authorization and authentication so they can focus on their\nreal work and forget about all that security stuff.\n\nBesides this talk Joel is planning a workshop on building a passwordless\nauthentication server.\n",
