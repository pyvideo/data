  "description": "Software Engineering is a new field, have we figured out all the ins and\nouts of how best to work in it?\n\nFor a lot of people the technology field has always been a semi-magical\nplace where engineers use their arcane knowledge to tease the secrets\nfrom the computer and unfortunately we have bought into this myth... Let\nus examine what are some of the myths surrounding out field and which\naspects might actually be useful. Is SW engineering an art or just\nanother skill? Is talent required? Does it even matter? What about the\n10X engineer...?\n\nI will be sharing some insights that I have learned from trying to\nanswer these questions for myself, part based on research, part on\npersonal opinion.\n",
