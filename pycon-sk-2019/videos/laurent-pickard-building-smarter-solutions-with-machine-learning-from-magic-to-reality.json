  "description": "\u201cAny sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\u201d\nWell, Machine Learning can look like magic, but you don't need to be a\ndata scientist or an ML researcher to develop with ML.\n\nSo, what about making your solution smarter without any knowledge in AI?\nWith pre-trained models and a few lines of code, Machine Learning APIs\ncan analyze your data. Moreover, AutoML techniques can now help in\ngetting even more specific insights tailored to your needs.\n\nIn this session, you'll see how to transform or extract information from\ntext, image, audio & video with the latest ML APIs, how to train an\nAutoML custom model, and you'll be an active player of a live demo.\nDon't put your smartphone in airplane mode!\n",
