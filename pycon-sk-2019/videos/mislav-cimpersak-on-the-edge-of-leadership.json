  "description": "How to lead a dev team with zero personal experience in people\nmanagement while still having no idea how to manage even your own time.\nAfter several years of fairly regular software developer career path,\nI've found myself in a new role that I've unconsciously put myself into.\nBeing a solid senior developer, management at the time agreed that I am\na good candidate for the team lead. Being promoted to a new personal\nlevel of incompetence I felt lost and confused in my new role, but made\na pact with myself to see this one through to the end. And so it came\nthat for the past few years, I've been development team lead for several\nteams.\n\nWith zero formal training, relying on my intuition and various random\npieces of advice I picked up from people smarter than me I've more or\nless successfully lead my teams to their goals. On that path, I've\nlearned tremendously, improved myself and hopefully, my teams. I would\nlike to share what worked and what didn't, my emotions, my regrets, and\nmy wins.\n",
