  "description": "Python may be one of the simplest and most flexible programming\nlanguages out there, but it is still a programming language. It still\nhas syntax, datatypes, and some occasional dark corners. Python \u201cwarts\u201d\nare things for which people have criticised Python, typically aspects of\nthe language or mechanisms of its implementation, because such aspects\neither expose certain surprising inconsistencies, are regarded as\nomissions, or cause irritation for parts of the community in some sense.\nThis talk will be about common pitfalls (termed warts/landmines) that\npeople face using Python programming language.\n\nThe only pre-requisite is a basic familiarity with Python programming\nlanguage. Although it\u2019ll be good that you have laptops with Python\nalready setup, it\u2019s not required as such !\n",
