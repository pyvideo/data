But until a machine learning model is\ndeployed to production the value delivered to companies is approximately\nequal to zero. Together with the common mantra that data science can't\nuse agile/lean frameworks or that the best software engineering\npractises don't apply explains a lot about why often companies got burnt\nwith their data science projects and why generally they under delivered.\n\nMLOps is here to help, the machine-learning equivalent of DevOps: it\nsolves the problems of implementing machine-learning in production.\nDuring this talk I will introduce the data science lifecycle, the\nconcept of machine learning Ops, its characteristics, why is extremely\nrequired, how it compares to DevOps, how it will become a required\ncapabilities for any DS/ML/AI Team, tools available and how you can\nstart with it.\n",
