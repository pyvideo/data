  "description": "Using Python for Natural Language Generation and Analysis\n\nPresented by Tennessee J Leeuwenburg (Australian Government Bureau of\nMeteorology)\n\nPython is used within the Bureau of Meteorology to automatically\ngenerate weather forecast text based on numerical data. In addition, the\ndevelopment team has also used Python to introspect the forecast\nlanguage and statistics used in the past. NTLK is an open-source\nlanguage processing toolkit which can be used for visualising language\npatterns. This presentation will talk about some of the techniques used\nfor automatically describing datasets and also how NTLK can be used to\ndiscover information about language uses and requirements in an\norganisation.\n",
