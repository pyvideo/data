Well give you a crash course on the basics of\nPython. We'll start off with why Python is unique compared to other\nlanguages and then quickly start into basic syntax, data types, and the\nPython philosophy for coding.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: The presenter dropped the mic on the ground and there\nit lay. So the sound kind of sucks.]\n",
