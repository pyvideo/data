  "description": "Django and Google App Engine: Why I'm Using Flask and Amazon EC2\n\nPresented by Ben Rousch\n\nI'm a lazy coder, but not the good kind of lazy. I dove into Django so I\ncould have one web framework that would work on many kind of hosting\nsetups and for any kind of web project. With some modifications, I could\neven use the laziest application host, Google App Engine. Some of these\ndecisions didn't work out, so I'll share some of the lessons I've\nlearned the past year or so.\n",
