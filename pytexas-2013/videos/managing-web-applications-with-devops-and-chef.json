  "description": "Modern web development often forces a separation between the developers who write the code, and the sysadmins who become responsible to maintain the application they create. DevOps is a philosophy of managing the entire lifecycle of an application, from development to operations, so that reliability and consistency of the system is the goal. This talk will discuss how the College of Architecture has implemented the DevOps methodology for our Django-based web applications using Chef. I'll talk about how Chef helps us quickly deploy and manage highly-available web apps, and about the shifting line between the developers and operations team, and where Chef has caused us to re-think those boundaries.",
