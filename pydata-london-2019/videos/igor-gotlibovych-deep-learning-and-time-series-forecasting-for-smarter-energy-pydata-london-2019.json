  "description": "Slides - https://tech.octopus.energy/data-discourse/PyData2019/TimeSeries.html\n\nBalancing the supply and demand of electrical energy relies heavily on accurate forecasting and probabilistic decision-making. In this talk, we will aim to demystify time series forecasting, and demonstrate how a single forecasting framework built on pandas, scikit and tensorflow allows us to extend simple models by applying transfer learning, auto-encoders and stochastic modelling.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
