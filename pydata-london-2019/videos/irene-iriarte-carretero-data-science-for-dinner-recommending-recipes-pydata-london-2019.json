  "description": "During this talk, I will discuss Gousto's journey (both the highs and the lows!) to implementing our recipe recommendation system. Being able to recommend the right recipes is a crucial part of offering a convenient service and we have therefore implemented several approaches. I will go through the different recommendation methods and the learnings we have taken from each of them.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
