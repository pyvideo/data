  "description": "LLM's can be supercharged using a technique called RAG, allowing us to overcome dealbreaker problems like hallucinations or no access to internal data. RAG is gaining more industry momentum and is becoming rapidly more mature both in the open-source world and at major Cloud vendors. But what can we expect from RAG? What is the current state of the tech in the industry? What use-cases work well and which are more challenging? Let's find out together!\n\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a popular technique to combine retrieval methods like vector search together with Large Language Models (LLM's). This gives us several advantages like retrieving extra information based on a user search query: allowing us to quote and cite LLM-generated answers. Because the underlying techniques are very broadly applicable, many types of data can be used to build up a RAG system, like textual data, tables, graphs or even images.\n\nIn this talk, we will deep dive into this popular emerging technique. Together, we will learn about: what the current state of RAG is, what tech is available to support you and what you expect to work well and what is still very challenging.\n\nJoin us if you \ud83e\udef5:\n- Are interested in GenAI / LLM's and RAG\n- Want to know more about the current state of RAG\n- Would like to know when you can most successfully apply RAG\n\nContents of the talk \ud83d\udccc\n[2 min] Intro\n[3 min] Why RAG?\nThe case for RAG\nThe RAG advantage\n\u2026 so how-to RAG?\n[10 min] Basic RAG: Which ingredients make up a successful RAG system?\nData ingestion (OCR, PDF reading)\nChunking\nVector search\nKeyword search\nMapping these components to the tech landscape \n\ud83d\udca5 Encountering difficulties\n[10 min] Advanced RAG: Going multimodal\nTabular data\nGraphs\nImages\n[4 min] Summing things up\nThe levels of RAG: from basic to advanced\nGenAI community \ud83e\udec2\nConcluding remarks\n[1 min] End\n[30 minutes total]\n\n\u2764\ufe0f Open Source Software\nRAG and LLM\u2019s are presented in a cloud-agnostic way.
