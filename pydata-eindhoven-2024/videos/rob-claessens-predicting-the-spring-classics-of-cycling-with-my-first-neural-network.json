  "description": "Last year I attended PyData Eindhoven for the first time. I got inspired and now I\u2019m back to present my first neural network, a network that was trained to predict the Spring Classics of cycling! With this neural network, I\u2019m attempting to beat my friends, and myself, in a well-known fantasy cycling game.\n\nIn this talk, I will elaborate on the process of building a model from scratch. This will include data collection, model training and finetuning, and of course a discussion of the predicted results. The predictions will also be compared to an existing cycling prediction platform that I use as benchmark. Lastly, I\u2019ll try to provide some insights into the model using SHAP values.",
