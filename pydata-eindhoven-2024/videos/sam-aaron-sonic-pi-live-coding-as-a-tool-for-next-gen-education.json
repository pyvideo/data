  "description": "Sonic Pi is a free code-based music creation and performance tool that targets both education and professional musicians. It is possible for beginners to code fresh beats, driving bass lines and shimmering synth riffs. All this whilst teaching core computer science concepts such as sequencing, functions, variables, loops, data structures and algorithms.\n\nThis talk will briefly introduce Sonic Pi before taking a deep technical nose-dive into some of the interesting requirements of live coding.\n\nSonic Pi is a free code-based music creation and performance tool that targets both education and professional musicians. It is possible for beginners to code fresh beats, driving bass lines and shimmering synth riffs. All this whilst teaching core computer science concepts such as sequencing, functions, variables, loops, data structures and algorithms.\n\nThis talk will briefly introduce Sonic Pi before taking a deep technical nose-dive into some of the interesting requirements of live coding systems. We'll touch on concurrency, distributed programming, temporal logic, deterministic randomisation, event streams, hot swapping code and domain specific languages.\n\nGet ready for some serious live coded beats and a window into an exciting future of computing education.",
