  "description": "In this speech, we want to introduce an AI PC, a single machine that consists of a CPU, GPU, and NPU (Neural Processing Unit) and can run GenAI in seconds, not hours. Besides the hardware, we will also show the OpenVINO Toolkit, a software solution that helps squeeze as much as possible out of that PC. Join our talk and see for yourself the AI PC is good for both generative and conventional AI models. All presented demos are open source and available on our GitHub.\n\nIn this speech, we want to introduce an AI PC, a single machine capable of hosting diverse AI applications that can run GenAI in seconds, not hours. Such an approach for local AI allows us to overcome the usual issues associated with Cloud AI, such as the risk of data privacy breaches, high latency, and dependency on a connection to the cloud.\n\nBesides the AI PC, we will also showcase the OpenVINO Toolkit, which is an open-source toolkit for optimizing and deploying deep learning models. It helps to maximize the AI performance of the PC. Join our talk and see for yourself how the AI PC is well-suited for both generative and conventional AI models. All the presented demos, such as background blurring and image generation using a latent consistency model, are open-source and available on our GitHub.",
