  "description": "In 2000 David Scherer created Visual, a python package with a simple interface for drawing 3D objects to the screen. Visual abstracted away calls to OpenGL vertex drawing, textures, and transformations, and allowed primitive geometric objects to be placed on the screen in an intuitive manner. Visual was subsequently adopted by many researchers and university instructors, primarily in physics, to visualize scientific results and simulation assignments. The original Visual module used C++ to make OpenGL calls, and compatibility with Linux was never implemented. Python and OpenGL have come a long way in the past sixteen years, and now Visual can be made cross-platform by removing the C++ backend. I will present my attempt to re-implement Visual using pyglet, as well as demonstrate its API and usage in education and research visualization.",
