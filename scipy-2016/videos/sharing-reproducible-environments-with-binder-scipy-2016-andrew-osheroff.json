  "description": "Binder (http://mybinder.org) is a service that bundles GitHub repositories with code, Jupyter notebooks, and data into reproducible, executable environments that can be launched instantaneously in the browser with the click of a button. Under the hood, Binder uses simple and flexible dependency specifications to build Docker images on demand, and then launches and schedules them across a public Kubernetes cluster. In this talk, I\u2019ll describe in detail how Binder works, and highlight some exciting use cases. I\u2019ll then describe several future directions for the project, including handling larger datasets, lowering barriers for environment specification, and supporting custom deployments with user-provided computing resources.",
