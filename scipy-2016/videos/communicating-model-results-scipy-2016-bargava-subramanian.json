  "description": "For a data scientist building predictive models, the following are important:\n\n1. How good is the model ?\n2. How good is it compared to competing/alternate models?\n3. Is there a way to identify what worked in the models built so far, to leverage it to build something even better?\n\nThe stakeholder/end-user who finally uses the output from the model, for whom the ML process is mostly black-box, is concerned with the following:\n\n1. How to trust the model output?\n2. How to understand the drivers?\n3. How to do what-if analysis?\n\nThe unifying theme that could answer most of the above questions is visualization. The biggest challenge is to find a way to visualize the model, the model fitting process and the impact of drivers. This talk summarizes the learnings and key takeaways when communicating model results.",
