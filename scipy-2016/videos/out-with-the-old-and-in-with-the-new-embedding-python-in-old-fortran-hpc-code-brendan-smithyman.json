  "description": "Seismic Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI) is a field with decades-old academic codes. The program Fullwv started life in 1989, written in Fortran 77 by numerous researchers. We detail how we extended Fullwv and embedded a new Python-based FWI package called Zephyr. We override or replace portions of the Fortran source code with Python, to enable rapid development of new algorithms and methods.",
