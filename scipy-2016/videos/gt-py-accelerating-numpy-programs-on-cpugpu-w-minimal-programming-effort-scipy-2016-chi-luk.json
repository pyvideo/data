  "description": "GT-Py is a newly developed just-in-time compiler that can offload NumPy code to hardware accelerators with relatively little programming effort. It lets programmers add pragmas to a Python program to specify what need to be offloaded, without writing the actual offloading code. By generating OpenCL code, GT-Py can run on a variety of accelerators including GPUs from different vendors, multicore CPUs, and potentially FPGAs. Experimental results demonstrate that significant performance gains, as much as over 9000x faster than the Python interpreter execution, can be obtained by adding only a couple of pragmas to the NumPy program. GT-Py supports both Python 2.7 and Python 3.4+. It will be available to public use for free.",
