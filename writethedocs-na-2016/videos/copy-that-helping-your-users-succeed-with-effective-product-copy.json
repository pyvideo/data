  "description": "Sarah Day\nhttp://lanyrd.com/2016/writethedocs/sfbzrz/\nIn this talk, I\u2019ll discuss my adventures learning to write effective product copy for web and mobile apps. I\u2019m a passionate believer that app copy is a magical panacea for bad user experience. When presented effectively, good copy decreases nearly every problem your users face, including frustration, ignorance, and workflow obstruction.\nI\u2019ll cover the following points in more detail:\nHow unified naming conventions can decrease user stress and make engineers\u2019 jobs easier.\nHow effective in-app help guides users through complex workflows.\nHow to present context-based education, rather than comprehensive education. * One tricky field needs a sensible name, or even one good tooltip, not a link to a help center article that only has two lines about that one tricky field.\nHow effective app copy is a free way to introduce and reaffirm your product\u2019s brand and voice.\nHow effective app copy increases user retention in your app, and decreases frustration and fear.\nApp copy is documentation for people who don\u2019t know your knowledge base exists.",
