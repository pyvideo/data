  "description": "Tracy Osborn\nhttp://lanyrd.com/2016/writethedocs/sfbztf/\nYou\u2019re smart, educated, and you\u2019ve been working in this industry for years. You\u2019ve created amazing open-source packages and great documentation. But all that flies out the window if what you write about your project isn\u2019t being read.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s comprehensive! It has all the info that I would need!\u201d you may reply.\nThe problem is not writing for people like you; it\u2019s writing and creating documentation that anyone can read, understand, and get excited about. This is true for projects aimed at beginners, but it goes double for projects and writing aimed at intermediate/expert programmers. Your projects will benefit when you write something that everyone can understand and would want to read. More readers = more users = perhaps more contributors!",
