These changes bring not only unprecedented opportunities but also unprecedented challenges.\nToday&#39;s technical communicators need to adapt to cope with this change. In this talk, Tina the Tech Writer is back, now leading a team of writers. The team has been almost too successful at proving the value of documentation. Facing a mountain of urgent requests for documentation coverage, potential writer burnout, and attrition, she puts her hedgehog brain skills to practical application on a plan to bring the team to new levels of engagement, happiness, and value -- all while learning to say no when appropriate. It&#39;s all about balance. Tina will share results from her team&#39;s experiment, while outlining a way you can design your own plan to balance any set of challenges and opportunities you&#39;re facing.",
