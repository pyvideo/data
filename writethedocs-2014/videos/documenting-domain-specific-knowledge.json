  "description": "Most of my career as a software engineer, I've written documentation for very general purpose tools, where users' had an existing familiarity. For the last six months I've been working on a cryptography library, a domain most developers are ignorant of. We set out with the goal of making our documentation accessible to any developer, regardless of previous cryptographic experience, which presents unique challenges. This talk will dive into what these challenges are, and how we try to solve them.",
