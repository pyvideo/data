This enhancement of exception and cancellation handling has allowed asyncio to evolve more flexibly, addressing the existing issues with asyncio APIs, such as insufficient cancellation and exception handling in asyncio.gather.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I would like to discuss the problems of existing asyncio APIs and how the newly introduced asyncio.TaskGroup() solves these issues. Attendees will learn about the improved way of handling exceptions and cancellations using asyncio.TaskGroup(), enabling them to write more efficient and robust asynchronous code with Python 3.11.\n\n\n\n🚀 講者介紹 About Speaker - Junya Fukuda 🚀\nDevelops \"LOVOT\", a family-like robot that promotes the ability to love, at GROOVE X, Inc.
