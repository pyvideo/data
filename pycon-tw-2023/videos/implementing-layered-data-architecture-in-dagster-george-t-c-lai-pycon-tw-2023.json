Compared to the imperative way how data engineers build ETL/ELT data pipelines in the last decade, layered data architecture could be of great help in improving data quality steadily and progressively, and reducing data silos while project-specific teams are autonomously producing various data products. We will introduce, in this share, a technical solution based on layered data architecture. The solution is implemented by means of Dagster, a cloud-native data orchestrator with integrated lineage, observability, and a declarative programming model. A simple example will be presented in this talk to demonstrate concepts, principles, and data stack of the solution. In the end, the benefits we have gained from the implementation experience will be conveyed as well.\n\n\ud83e\udea7 \u6295\u5f71\u7247 Slides\uff1ahttps://1drv.ms/p/s!AtNklwocKzYg8AEp6C6A-0jq8XN6?e=3ZFwU6\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \u8b1b\u8005\u4ecb\u7d39 About Speaker - George T. C., Lai \ud83d\ude80\nA data practitioner with data analysis background who has been developing career mainly in Big Data and DevOps based on cloud-native ecosystem for 12 years. In the recent 7 years, I have been focusing on Data Architect, team management, and DevOps. As to technical experience, I got 6 years on Hadoop ecosystem, especially on Hortonworks HDP, 7 years on Kubernetes and 4 years on AWS/GCP. My personal vision is to make each data practitioner have a better life. I am approaching the vision by exploring new tools, discovering best practices, and delivering well-designed data architectures and technical solutions for data practitioners to relief their pain points and frustrations when coping with data.\n\n\nFollow \u201cPyCon Taiwan\u201d\n\u2b50\ufe0f Official Website: https://tw.pycon.org\n\u2b50\ufe0f Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Twitter: https://twitter.com/PyConTW\n\u2b50\ufe0f LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Blogger: https://conf.python.tw/",
