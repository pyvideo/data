From balancing innovation and compatibility, to navigating the maze of language design, we will discuss what fortifies Python against change and how we prepare to make complicated decisions\u00a0that may change the language forever.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \u8b1b\u8005\u4ecb\u7d39 About Speaker - Pablo\u00a0Galindo\u00a0Salgado \ud83d\ude80\nPablo Galindo Salgado works in the Python Infrastructure team at the Software Infrastructure department at Bloomberg L.P.
