These tests may pass or fail inconsistently, making it difficult to trust the results and slowing down development workflows. In this talk, we'll explore the root causes of flaky tests in Python applications and provide practical strategies for finding, resolving, and preventing them.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \u8b1b\u8005\u4ecb\u7d39 About Speaker - Nisanthan Nanthakumar \ud83d\ude80\nI like to write code and travel.
