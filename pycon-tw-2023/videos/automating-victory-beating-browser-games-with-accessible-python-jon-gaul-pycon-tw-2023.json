In this talk we'll explore the power of intuitive Python libraries for I/O, then use them to automatically beat an in-browser video game using the same strategies and inputs as a human. We\u2019ll also discuss applying basic project management skills to take personal projects from ideas to successes. Whether you want to help robots take over the world or a good reminder of why you have to prove you\u2019re human online, this talk is for you!\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \u8b1b\u8005\u4ecb\u7d39 About Speaker -  Jon Gaul\ud83d\ude80\nGraduating from Georgia Tech with a dual degree in Computer Science and Chemical Engineering, Jon has long held a passion for investigating how the world works and how theory transforms into practice. This sense of curiosity has led him to Tokyo, Japan, where he works as a software engineer at HENNGE. He is excited to share his knowledge and deepen his relationship with the Python community.\n\nFollow \u201cPyCon Taiwan\u201d\n\u2b50\ufe0f Official Website: https://tw.pycon.org\n\u2b50\ufe0f Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Twitter: https://twitter.com/PyConTW\n\u2b50\ufe0f LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Blogger: https://conf.python.tw/",
