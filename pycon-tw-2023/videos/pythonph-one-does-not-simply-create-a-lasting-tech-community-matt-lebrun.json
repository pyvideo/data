They bring together people who share common altruistic goals, and the magic of collaboration and innovation flourishes. However, despite the abundance of positive outcomes, community stewards often face challenges such as burnout and succession planning. So the question remains: how do we make this good thing last?\r\n\r\nManaging a long-running organization is not easy but it can also be very fulfilling. By prioritizing leadership development and implementing measures to prevent burnout, we can ensure that our open source communities endure and continue to make an impact.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \u8b1b\u8005\u4ecb\u7d39 About Speaker - Matt Lebrun \ud83d\ude80\nMatt is a software engineer and the president of the Python Philippines community.
