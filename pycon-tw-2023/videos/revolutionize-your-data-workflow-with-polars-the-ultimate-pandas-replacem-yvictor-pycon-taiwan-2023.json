With its optimized implementation of data structures and algorithms, Polars offers superior performance in joining, aggregating, and manipulating large datasets.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking to revolutionize your data workflow, Polars may just be the ultimate replacement for Pandas. Whether you're working with big data, complex operations, or demanding computational tasks, Polars can help you get the job done faster and more efficiently.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we'll take a closer look at the advantages of using Polars over Pandas, and explore some real-world examples of how Polars can improve your data workflow. We'll also discuss some of the key features and functionalities of Polars, including its support for multi-threading, columnar memory layout, and native integration with Rust.\n\n\ud83e\udea7 \u6295\u5f71\u7247 Slides\uff1ahttps://slides.com/d/dFhlMlI/live\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \u8b1b\u8005\u4ecb\u7d39 About Speaker - YVictor \ud83d\ude80\nSpecializing in Event-Driven Architecture for trading, my focus is designing and implementing systems that empower businesses in the financial industry.
