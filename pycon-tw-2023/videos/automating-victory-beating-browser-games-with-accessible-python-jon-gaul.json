In this talk we'll explore the power of intuitive Python libraries for I/O, then use them to automatically beat an in-browser video game using the same strategies and inputs as a human. We’ll also discuss applying basic project management skills to take personal projects from ideas to successes. Whether you want to help robots take over the world or a good reminder of why you have to prove you’re human online, this talk is for you!\n\n🚀 講者介紹 About Speaker -  Jon Gaul🚀\nGraduating from Georgia Tech with a dual degree in Computer Science and Chemical Engineering, Jon has long held a passion for investigating how the world works and how theory transforms into practice. This sense of curiosity has led him to Tokyo, Japan, where he works as a software engineer at HENNGE. He is excited to share his knowledge and deepen his relationship with the Python community.\n\nFollow “PyCon Taiwan”\n⭐️ Official Website: https://tw.pycon.org\n⭐️ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pycontw\n⭐️ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/pycontw\n⭐️ Twitter: https://twitter.com/PyConTW\n⭐️ LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pycontw\n⭐️ Blogger: https://conf.python.tw/",
