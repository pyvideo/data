This is crucial for ensuring that AI systems are transparent, accountable, and trustworthy, and do not make biased or discriminatory decisions. Python offers various libraries that can be used to improve the interpretability of AI algorithms in a variety of situations, such as enhancing transparency in decision-making systems or facilitating communication between AI experts and non-experts. In this hands-on tutorial, you will learn how to use these tools to improve the interpretability of AI algorithms in Python, and explore key metrics and evaluation methods for measuring the effectiveness of XAI techniques. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a better understanding of how to make your AI systems more transparent and trustworthy.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \u8b1b\u8005\u4ecb\u7d39 About Speaker - Neeraj Pandey \ud83d\ude80\nNeeraj is a polyglot and open-source contributor.
