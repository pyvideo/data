However, there are some cases where users want to run their apps offline or without sending sensitive data to remote servers. To address these concerns, we introduce '[stlite](https://github.com/whitphx/stlite)': a WebAssembly port of Streamlit. It provides offline capability, data privacy, scalability, and multi-platform portability including desktop app packaging, while preserving Streamlit's original features, such as Python productivity and its rich ecosystem.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will discuss the benefits of stlite and demonstrate how to build and deploy stlite applications in a variety of ways, using ML/CV examples.\r\nWe will also look at its internals from a technical point of view, which may inspire you with ideas on how to make use of Pyodide and how to transform Python frameworks for the Pyodide/Wasm runtime.\r\n\r\nYou can try out stlite online: https://edit.share.stlite.net/\n\n\ud83e\udea7 \u6295\u5f71\u7247 Slides\uff1ahttps://slides.com/whitphx/streamlit-meets-webassembly-stlite\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \u8b1b\u8005\u4ecb\u7d39 About Speaker - Yuichiro Tachibana \ud83d\ude80\nYuichiro works as a professional software developer and also loves contributing to OSS projects.\r\nAs a Pythonista, he has participated in various projects including web development, multimedia streaming, data management, computer vision, and machine learning.\n\n\nFollow \u201cPyCon Taiwan\u201d\n\u2b50\ufe0f Official Website: https://tw.pycon.org\n\u2b50\ufe0f Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Twitter: https://twitter.com/PyConTW\n\u2b50\ufe0f LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Blogger: https://conf.python.tw/",
