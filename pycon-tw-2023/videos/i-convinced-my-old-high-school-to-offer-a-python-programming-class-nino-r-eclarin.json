One of the most common request is to help students doing their research investigatory project integrate coding and programming as our school doesn't have any robotics or programming related class offering.\r\n\r\nWhen I started my masters degree, I know for sure that I won't have that much time to help them so I told them, \"Hey, can you just create a python class for students\"? And to my surprise, they did!\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll discuss the challenges of implementing and adding a new course to an existing curriculum. Not to mention the difficulty of having limited resources like computers, budget, etc. It's a nightmare! But we made it happen regardless.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \u8b1b\u8005\u4ecb\u7d39 About Speaker - Ni\u00f1o R. Eclarin \ud83d\ude80\nHi, I'm Ninz. \r\n\r\nJust finished my masters degree and currently started as an MLOps Engineer in Sydney. Doing some volunteer work for the dev community. Also doing some research with local schools, helping students apply machine learning and programming to their studies.\r\n\r\nYou can talk to me about cycling, music, ML, and the universe in general. :D\n\n\nFollow \u201cPyCon Taiwan\u201d\n\u2b50\ufe0f Official Website: https://tw.pycon.org\n\u2b50\ufe0f Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Twitter: https://twitter.com/PyConTW\n\u2b50\ufe0f LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Blogger: https://conf.python.tw/",
