  "description": "We provide foundations of decision tree induction and how it relates to contrast pattern-based classification. In particular, we will introduce BPC4cip, a contrast pattern-based classifier with highly competitive performance, that can provide explanations behind any classification decision and that has shown to behave adequately in the context of class imbalance problems.",
