  "description": "We've been told to stop writing objects. We've been told to write more objects. But what exactly do we really write when we write something? In this talk, we cover the Python datamodels sources and how do they interact?, when to begin writing objects, what methods to start with that leverage the Python data models, and how to use the \"magic\" methods of Python. This talk assumes you know all of the basic builtin data structures of Python and have familiarity with operators. Which should we be doing? When? How?",
