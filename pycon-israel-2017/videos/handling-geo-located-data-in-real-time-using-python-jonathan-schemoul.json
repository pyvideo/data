  "description": "When we get geographic data from sensors, be it indoor positioning, GPS, or anything else, we need to handle it correctly. We (of course) have a lot of tools in Python to do so. What if you get a ton of this data coming continuously and have to display it, make real-time calculations, controls, reports and other operations ? Let's see one of the possible approaches to this problem using AsyncIO, MongoDB, a web app and Pandas reports, including how I implemented it for some clients (a live demo, if internet access permits it).",
