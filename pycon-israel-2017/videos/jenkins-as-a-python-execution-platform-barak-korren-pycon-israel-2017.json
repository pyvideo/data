  "description": "Jenkins is a very useful tool for building automation systems. Jenkins jobs typically get written as a mix of shell scripts and plug-in invocations, but as Python developers we prefer to do things with Python. In this presentation we will look into various tricks for implementing Jenkins job logic in Python starting with running simple scripts and going up to passing objects around and running stateful applications.",
