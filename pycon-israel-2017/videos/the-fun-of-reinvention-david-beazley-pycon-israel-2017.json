  "description": "In the early days of Python, the \"F\" may have been a key to its early success.  It was just the sort of magic power that made hard problems easier and impossible problems possible.  It was what made you want to program in your spare time.  It made management ask probing questions such as \"who gave you permission to do this?\"  No, the \"F\" was an unstoppable force for good.  As Python has matured, discussions of the \"F\" have often given way to more serious topics such as Unicode, packaging, and backwards compatibility.   However, it never really went away.  In fact, it's been sitting their in plain sight all along--growing in power.  In this talk,  I'll give a forward-looking discussion of Python's future and exploiting the power of the \"F\".  ",
