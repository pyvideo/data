  "description": "Python is gaining speed as a leading data science programming language, alongside R. An essential part of data science is data visualization, something easily achieved with popular plotting library Matplotlib. While matplotlib is powerful and versatile, R has one advantage with respect to plotting: ggplot2, which easily generates beautiful charts out of the box. In this talk we will demonstrate how to painlessly generate eye candy charts with Matplotlib, using styles, color maps, full chart customization and clever subplotting with figures and axis objects. We'll also briefly discuss basic and advanced interactivity for Jupyter notebooks and beyond.",
