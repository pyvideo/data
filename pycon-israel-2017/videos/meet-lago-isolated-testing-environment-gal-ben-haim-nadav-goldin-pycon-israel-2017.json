  "description": "In this talk we will introduce a powerful Python open source project called Lago, which allows you to create fully isolated virtualized environment and interact with it using a Python API. Based on a real-life example of testing a complex project, we will go over the cons of using legacy methods for running system tests, and we will show how Lago can be used to overcome them while introducing additional cool features, such as running the whole testing suite on your laptop!",
