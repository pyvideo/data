  "description": "The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis states that language limits cognition; that the words we use influence the thoughts we have. This happens in code, too: programmers using different programming languages solve problems differently. Can we use this to our advantage? Let's unit test C code with pytest. Let's do autocompletion with a single script that's both Python and Bash. Let's write a Django server and extend its working API in its admin interface. Let's talk about Whorfian Refactoring.",
