  "description": "A great set of tools exists to check the source code for compliance with Python coding standards such as PEP 8. Those tools are useful to control code quality during code review and on continuous integration stage. However, the standards do not cover everything and each team may have additional coding guidelines in place. Conveniently the Python ecosystem allows easy creation of custom source code checks, so your local code style conventions that are outside of existing tools coverage should not be left for a manual review process only. This talk will focus on how automation of code checks outside of PEP 8 standard can be done.",
