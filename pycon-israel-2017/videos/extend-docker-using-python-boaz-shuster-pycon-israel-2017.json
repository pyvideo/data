  "description": "Docker is the most popular platform to run Python applications within containers. Many companies are using this platform to either deploy micro-services or test the code changes before merging it to production. Docker has 3 extension points: Drivers, Plugins and user-facing API. I am going to focus on the latter (user-facing API) and by the end of the talk, you will learn Docker's REST API and know how to extend Docker capabilities using Python.",
