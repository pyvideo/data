  "description": "This talk will present the solution used to win 1st place in Nexar\u2019s traffic light recognition challenge. We will go over the process of how to start with a basic deep learning model and improve it over time. The talk will focus on the ideas and process more than the technical implementation. No need for strong background in deep learning to understand all the concepts in this talk.",
