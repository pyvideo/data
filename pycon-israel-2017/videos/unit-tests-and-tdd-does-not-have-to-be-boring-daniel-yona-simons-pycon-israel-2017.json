  "description": "When reviewing your Python applications for quality, we are constantly pushed to improve our \u2018code coverage\u2019 and improve our unit test quality, since so often we are caught out during upgrades and re factoring, by a lack of broad regression tests. As an experienced programmer who was a Python newby, the whole unit test backlog for existing code in my new job was terrifying, so I needed to do something different... Here are practical examples of using Python for web programming where writing unit tests as part of the initial development processes, using Test Driven Design (TDD) methodologies, not only creates reliable regression tests for future code quality and maintenance, but also speeds up the development time, and gives a clearer path to deployment. The focus and examples are on web development, but the lessons and ideas are good for other development areas.",
