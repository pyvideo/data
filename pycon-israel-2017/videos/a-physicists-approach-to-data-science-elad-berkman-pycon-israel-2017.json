  "description": "One of the main challenges of developing algorithms for a dynamic, data intensive, and \"noisy\" environment is being able to monitor system performance and understand the impact of each element or change. Using basic principles, we developed a model that estimates key performance metrics. Used in an unconventional way, the model allows us to gain significant insight on global system behavior and performance, and impact of updates to the core algorithm's logic. This model has proven extremely powerful at Via. We have developed and deployed the world's first operating system for on-demand dynamic public transit. Our solution is operating at scale in New-York, Chicago, DC, Paris and is growing rapidly to additional locations.",
