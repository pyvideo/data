  "description": "This example-heavy talk, might give you everything you need to start having fun with Django Channels. Channels allow us to add features such as real time communication to our apps; without giving up the framework we love. Now we can use websockets and stay pythonic. Perhaps more importantly they provide opportunities for fun. We may answer client\u2019s demands for features such as messaging while maintaining a consistent stack. Further, no longer do we have to consider expensive SASS style solutions, which lack flexibility. From realtime-chat to collaborative drawing canvases, Ronnie demonstrates how simple and playful you may find channels. Finally, we will talk about the nut\u2019s and bolts that make up this powerful tool.",
