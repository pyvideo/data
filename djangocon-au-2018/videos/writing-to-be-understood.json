  "description": "As developers, we write a lot more than just code. We write commit messages; we\nreview our colleagues\u2019 code; we email collaborators; we tweet our hottest\ntakes. \n\nGood written communication can make your systems easier to use and maintain,\nencourage your colleagues to be more receptive to your suggestions, and make\nyou more popular on the internet. I\u2019ll share some practical ways to communicate\nmore effectively, and some less practical theory about how people and language\nwork.",
