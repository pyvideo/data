  "description": "This talk answers the question \u201cwhat is a Data Generating Process and why does it matter?\u201d While we will begin our discussion with a bit of theory, don\u2019t worry about this being too technical or inaccessible if you\u2019re new to Bayesian Statistics. The primary goal is to focus on the second half of the question and give you tools to use for real-world applications.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nDante Gates is a Data Scientist in Philadelphia. Throughout his career, his focus has been using machine learning and probabilistic methods to build practical products. Currently, he works at Perpay, a FinTech startup helping underserved consumers build credit. Previous experience includes industries such as Adtech and Health Care.",
