  "description": "Dynamic data are all around us. Changepoint models allow us to know when changes happen in these data and what they look like. Probabilistic modelling allows us to elegantly build customizable changepoint models for different data types, as well as provide us with uncertainty estimates for the position and magnitude of the change (both indispensable quantities for decision-making and hypothesis testing). This tutorial will briefly cover building changepoint models for multivariate data using PyMC but will primarily focus on the ways in which this \u201cbasic\u201d model can be extended.\n\nThis tutorial is targeted towards academic researchers, data scientists, and anyone interested in being able to easily build bespoke models which provide uncertainty estimates for inferred statistics. This talk will attempt to be accessible to beginners but leans towards more intermediate users interested in changepoint modelling. Previous experience with PyMC, and a background in statistical modelling is assumed. No libraries other than PyMC and the basic scientific stack (numpy, scipy, matplotlib) will be used.\n\nThe tutorial aims to be hands-on, will discuss some theory to provide context for the models discussed, and will be heavy on understanding code to construct the \u201cguts\u201d of the models (in particular, selection of distributions for modelling the emissions and changepoint locations, and the details of the tensor manipulation to put everything together).\nThe tutorial will be divided into three parts:\n\nIntroduction to changepoint modelling and use cases.\nConstruction of the \u201cbasic\u201d multivariate changepoint model.\nExtensions to the \u201cbasic\u201d model:\n- Handling drift/noise in repeated observations using mixture emissions across multiple timeseries observations.\n- Determining the distribution over number of changepoints using a Dirichlet Process prior.\n\nContent:\n\ud83c\udfa5 Abuzar's Interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySF3X45XRyQ\n\ud83c\udfa5 Walkthrough of changepoint modelling in PyMC: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwNju1o5yQo\n\ud83d\udcdd Code Notebook: https://github.com/abuzarmahmood/pymcon_bayesian_changepoint/blob/72102ad6149b86d586595bf4523f40f66eb20c25/Bayesian_Changepoint_Zoo_neural_data.ipynb\n\ud83d\udc49 Discourse Post for more details and discussion: https://discourse.pymc.io/t/13251\n\n\n\ud83d\udce2 PyMCon is a community conference that shares the latest in statistical practices, tricks, and tips.
