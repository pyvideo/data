  "description": "We highly recommend following along with the tutorial on UM-Bridge docs: https://um-bridge-benchmarks.readthedocs.io/en/docs/tutorial.html\n\nTreating uncertainties is essential in the design of safe aircraft, medical decision making, and many other fields. UM-Bridge enables straightforward uncertainty quantification (UQ) on advanced models by removing technical barriers.\n\nComplex numerical models often consist of large code bases that are difficult to integrate with UQ packages such as PyMC, holding back many interesting applications. UM-Bridge is a universal interface for linking UQ and models, greatly accelerating development from prototype to high-performance computing.\n\nThis hands-on tutorial teaches participants how to build UQ applications using PyMC and UM-Bridge. We cover a range of practical exercises ranging from basic toy examples all the way to controlling parallelized models on a live cloud cluster. Beyond that, we encourage participants to bring their own methods and problems.\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Check out the tutorial slides here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ccw1Qs0JiHTYKCDFJncaHPwJF2_n27xS/view?usp=sharing\nCode: https://um-bridge-benchmarks.readthedocs.io/en/docs/tutorial.html\n\nGive it a try now, and don't forget to RSVP for their upcoming Q&A session to explore more about Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and UM-Bridge. \ud83e\udd13\ud83d\udd0d\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Register for the upcoming Q&A sessions:\n1.
