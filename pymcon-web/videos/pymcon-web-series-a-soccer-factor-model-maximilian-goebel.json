  "description": "In this event, we will learn about Sports Analytics and player assessment with Maximilian Goebel, a Post-Doc in finance and economics at Bocconi University. \ud83d\udcca\u26bd\ufe0f\n\nIn this talk, Maximilian Goebel draws inspiration from the asset-pricing literature to determine a soccer player's \"alpha,\" which represents their inherent skill. Learn how the SFM evaluates a player's probability of scoring a goal while taking into account various factors attributed to their team's performance. The ultimate goal is to assess whether a player's observed goals accurately reflect their true skill and ability.\n\n\ud83d\udcd3 Access the notebook with code and examples: https://github.com/maxi-tb22/SFM/blob/main/PyMCon/SFM_redacted.ipynb\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Also, don't miss our exclusive interview with Maximilian Goebel, where he shares his journey and his passion for Bayesian statistics.
