  "description": "To learn about upcoming events check out the website: https://pymcon.com/events/\n\nPyMC has now multiple options to boost its performance (JAX support, training on GPUs, etc). The library is widely known for being easy to learn and for its great documentation, but it\u2019s not always seen as a performant tool. Sandra wrote a detailed blog post in which she presented a benchmarking template, demonstrating that PyMC can work with large datasets and illustrating different approaches to doing so. The benchmarking template itself was published as reproducible code so that the performance of future version of PyMC and/or other libraries can be tested. In addition, users can compare their own models using the code provided in the blog repository.\n\nFor the full details see the PyMC Discourse:\n\nhttps://discourse.pymc.io/t/pymcon-web-series-04-scalable-bayesian-modeling-mar-28-2023-sandra-yojana-meneses/11635",
