  "description": "Many people have heard of (or at least used) automatic differentiation, a set of routines that allow programs to compute partial derivatives from numerical functions. This innovation allowed a large class of users to benefit from gradient-based algorithms without having to understand or manually implement their own gradient functions.\n\nPyMC grabbed this idea and applied it to a completely novel context: automatic probability. With it, we can automatically derive and evaluate probability expressions from user-specified random functions. Similar to automatic differentiation, this allows users to create rich generative models and exploit probability-based algorithms (e.g., NUTS) without having to manually implement their own probability functions.\n\nIn this talk, we present this new foundation of PyMC and how it can (and is already) used to construct specialized classes of models, from arbitrary variable transformations to mixture distributions, censoring processes, and highly structured timeseries.\n\nThe goal is to understand what makes PyMC a true probabilistic programming language and how you can exploit it!\n\n\ud83d\udd17 You can see more details on the Discourse post: https://discourse.pymc.io/t/12274\n\ud83d\udd17 Register now for the upcoming Q&A session: https://www.meetup.com/pymc-online-meetup/events/294021273\n\n\ud83d\udce2 PyMCon is a community conference that shares the latest in statistical practices, tricks, and tips.
