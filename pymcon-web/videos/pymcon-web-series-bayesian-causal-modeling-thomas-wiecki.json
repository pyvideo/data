  "description": "Causal analysis is rapidly gaining popularity, but why? Machine learning methods might help us predict what's going to happen with great accuracy, but what's the value of that if it doesn't tell us what to do to achieve a desirable outcome? Without a causal understanding of the world, it's often impossible to identify which actions lead to a desired outcome.\n\nCausal analysis is often embedded in a frequentist framework, which comes with some well-documented baggage. In this talk, we will present how we can super-charge PyMC for Bayesian Causal Analysis by using a powerful new feature: the do operator.\n\nContent:\n\ud83d\udcd6 Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xRm3eTLumiiLaTCTcKFxfgNxa-_dTnDvxzKUxztq85E\n\ud83d\udcdd Code: https://www.pymc-labs.com/blog-posts/causal-analysis-with-pymc-answering-what-if-with-the-new-do-operator/\n\n\ud83d\udd17 You can see more details on the Discourse post: https://discourse.pymc.io/t/12912\n\ud83d\udd17 Register now for the upcoming Q&A session: https://www.meetup.com/pymc-online-meetup/events/296035699/\n\nAbout the Speaker:\nDr. Thomas Wiecki is an author of PyMC, the leading platform for statistical data science. To help businesses solve some of their trickiest data science problems, he assembled a world-class team of Bayesian modelers and founded PyMC Labs -- the Bayesian consultancy. He did his PhD at Brown University, studying cognitive neuroscience.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Connect with Thomas:\n\ud83d\udc49 Website: https://www.pymc-labs.com\n\ud83d\udc49 Twitter: https://twitter.com/twiecki\n\ud83d\udc49 GitHub: https://github.com/twiecki\n\n\ud83d\udce2 PyMCon is an asynchronous-first virtual conference for the Bayesian community.
