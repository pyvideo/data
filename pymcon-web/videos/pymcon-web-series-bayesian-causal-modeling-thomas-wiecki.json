Machine learning methods might help us predict what's going to happen with great accuracy, but what's the value of that if it doesn't tell us what to do to achieve a desirable outcome? Without a causal understanding of the world, it's often impossible to identify which actions lead to a desired outcome.\n\nCausal analysis is often embedded in a frequentist framework, which comes with some well-documented baggage. In this talk, we will present how we can super-charge PyMC for Bayesian Causal Analysis by using a powerful new feature: the do operator.\n\nContent:\n\ud83d\udcd6 Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xRm3eTLumiiLaTCTcKFxfgNxa-_dTnDvxzKUxztq85E\n\ud83d\udcdd Code: https://www.pymc-labs.com/blog-posts/causal-analysis-with-pymc-answering-what-if-with-the-new-do-operator/\n\n\ud83d\udd17 You can see more details on the Discourse post: https://discourse.pymc.io/t/12912\n\ud83d\udd17 Register now for the upcoming Q&A session: https://www.meetup.com/pymc-online-meetup/events/296035699/\n\nAbout the Speaker:\nDr. Thomas Wiecki is an author of PyMC, the leading platform for statistical data science. To help businesses solve some of their trickiest data science problems, he assembled a world-class team of Bayesian modelers and founded PyMC Labs -- the Bayesian consultancy. He did his PhD at Brown University, studying cognitive neuroscience.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Connect with Thomas:\n\ud83d\udc49 Website: https://www.pymc-labs.com\n\ud83d\udc49 Twitter: https://twitter.com/twiecki\n\ud83d\udc49 GitHub: https://github.com/twiecki\n\n\ud83d\udce2 PyMCon is an asynchronous-first virtual conference for the Bayesian community.
