  "description": "Ever wondered about the challenges of predicting hurricanes or making model-based inferences with uncertain data? The main challenge lies in combining advanced numerical simulation with Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) methods and high-performance computing systems, such as supercomputing and cloud computing.\n\nIn this video Linus discusses why we need UQ, the problems it poses, and how they built UM-Bridge to solve it! You will learn how UM-Bridge revolutionizes UQ in simulation codes, creating a universal interface for collaboration across programming languages and tools.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Stay tuned for our upcoming PyMCon talk, and be sure to register for the live Q&A session today to ensure you don't miss out.\n\n\ud83d\udccc For more information, check out our discourse post and RSVP to the meetup event for a reminder.\n\ud83d\udd17 PyMCon Website: https://pymcon.com/events/\n\ud83d\udc49 Discourse Post for more details and discussion: https://discourse.pymc.io/t/13583\n\ud83d\udd17 Register for the live Q&A session:\n1. 29th Jan at 7 am PST (3:00\u202fpm UTC)\ud83d\udc49 https://www.meetup.com/pymc-online-meetup/events/298279180/\n2. 30th Jan at 12 pm IST (6:30\u202fam UTC)\ud83d\udc49 https://www.meetup.com/pymc-online-meetup/events/298356399/\n\n\n\ud83d\udce2 PyMCon is a community conference that shares the latest in statistical practices, tricks, and tips.
