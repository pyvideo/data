The flow includes following parts:\n\n-  Machine Learning datasets storage and versioning via Quilt (as an\n   alternative to DVC)\n-  Experiments scheduling and infrastructure maintenance via Polyaxon\n-  Continuous Integration using CircleCI\n-  Configuration and deployment using Docker.\n\nPresentation describes of all components and explains how to put it\ntogether. Given Machine Learning flow impacted on on our projects'\nsuccess stories. Further part of the talk would explain why it was so\ncrucial to build and maintain it.\n",
