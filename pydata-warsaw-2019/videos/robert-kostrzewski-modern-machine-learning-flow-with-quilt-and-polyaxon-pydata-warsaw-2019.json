  "description": "Presentation of development flow dedicated to Machine Learning internal\nand external projects including datasets storage and versioning via\nQuilt (as an alternative to DVC), experiments scheduling and\ninfrastructure maintenance via Polyaxon, continuous Integration using\nCircleCI and Configuration & deployment using Docker.\n\nThe talk is about presenting a development flow dedicated to Machine\nLearning internal and external projects, practiced in our company\n(Netguru). The flow includes following parts:\n\n-  Machine Learning datasets storage and versioning via Quilt (as an\n   alternative to DVC)\n-  Experiments scheduling and infrastructure maintenance via Polyaxon\n-  Continuous Integration using CircleCI\n-  Configuration and deployment using Docker.\n\nPresentation describes of all components and explains how to put it\ntogether. Given Machine Learning flow impacted on on our projects'\nsuccess stories. Further part of the talk would explain why it was so\ncrucial to build and maintain it.\n",
