  "description": "Transfer learning has been changing the NLP landscape tremendously since the release of BERT one year ago. Transformers of all kinds have emerged, dominate most research leaderboards and have made their way into industrial applications. In this talk we will dissect the paradigm of transfer learning and its effects on pipelines, modelling and the engineers mindset.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
