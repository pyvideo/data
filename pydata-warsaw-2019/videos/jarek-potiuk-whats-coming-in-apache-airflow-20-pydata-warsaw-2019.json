  "description": "Apache Airflow is one of the most popular Data processing orchestration\nengines. After a long line of 1.10.x releases in December we wil be\nquickly approaching 2.0 release. The release is not backwards compatible\nand it will contain many improvement and changes. This talk will outline\nthe most important changes coming in Apache Airflow 2.0.\n\nJarek - as an Apache Airflow PMC member and one of the more active\nmembers of Apache Airflow community will talk about what is coming in\nApache Airflow 2.0. The Apache Airflow 2.0 is not backwards compatible\nand the community puts a lot of effort into cleaning up, refactoring and\nimproving the code and building functionaliities that are going to make\nlife easier for the users of this - one of the most popular -\norchestration engine for Data and Machine Learning processing jobs. Some\nof the most long-standing requests from the community, such as DAG\nserialisation to database and stateles webserver are only scratching the\nsurface of what's coming in Airflow 2.0.\n\nThis talk will be targeted mainly for Apache Airflow users who would\nlike to learn what can they do with the upcoming Airflow 2.0 as well as\nhow to migrate to Apache 2.0 i painlessly. It will also be a unique\nopportunity to provide feedback on early versions of Apache 2.0 that\nwill be available by then and discuss your proposals and questions with\nan Apache Airflow Commiter, so there will be plenty of time for\nquestions - during and after the talk.\n",
