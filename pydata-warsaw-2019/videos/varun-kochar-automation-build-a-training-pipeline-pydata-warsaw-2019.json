  "description": "Many of us knows how to train & deploy ML models in cloud, but doing so\nhave we become redundant. Running multiple experiments in single machine\n& waiting for tasks to complete cannot be time-efficient for big\ndatasets. Hence, we need an automation which can take over repetitive\nmanual tasks & spare us the time to do other important stuff. Aim is to\nshow how to deploy ML architecture in 60 SECONDS\n\nML pipeline consists of many manual tasks such as Data collection, Data\ncleaning, training environment setup, training configuration, monitoring\nprogress or model evaluation gig, all these components should be\nautomated & what you should be left with is just a single CONFIGURATION\ndocument with information of different set of experiments.\n",
