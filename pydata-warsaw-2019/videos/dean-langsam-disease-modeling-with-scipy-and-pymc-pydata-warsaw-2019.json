  "description": "Programs which aim eradicate disease must rely on interpretable models.\nThese models quickly become hard to solve, not to mention train on\nmissing parameters. Scipy and PyMC come to our rescue for the heavy\nlifting.\n\nIn 2018, Israel has seen the biggest outbreak of measles since the\nintroduction of a vaccine in the late 1960s. Nowadays, vaccine policies\nare not only decided by laboratory tests. Those tests are complemented\nby a plethora of computational epidemiology simulations predicting the\neffects of various vaccination policies on the entire population. A\npopulation-level policy to eradicate disease must rely on Interpretable\nmodels. These models quickly become hard to solve, not to mention train\non missing parameters. Using Scipy as a solver, and PyMC for Bayesian\ninference we are able to learn parameter distributions for missing\nnatural parameters, such as the disease's \"strength\" or\n\"infectiousness\". We can then use the underlying distributions for these\nparameters in order to simulate possible outcomes for future policies.\n",
