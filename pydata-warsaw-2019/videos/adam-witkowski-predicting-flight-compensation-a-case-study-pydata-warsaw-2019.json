  "description": "Under EU law, airplane passengers have the right to be compensated if their flight is sufficiently delayed. GIVT helps passengers file such claims. Every claim needs to be verified as there are various conditions that can invalidate it: extreme weather, strikes, bird hit, etc. In this talk, I will describe a machine learning system which replaces manual verification of claims.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
