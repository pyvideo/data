  "description": "During this talk, I will share my experience gathered during the\ndevelopment of Allegro's visual search engine. I will present our entire\njourney from the plain idea through different modelling approaches up to\nits current solution. Finally, I will provide some tips and tricks that\nwe have learned along the way and show a lot of images - after all,\nthat's what you're looking for!\n\nHow can one effectively find a recently seen t-shirt on an e-commerce\nplatform such as Allegro? Or maybe an unusual set of cups, that is used\nby the coffee shop downstairs? One could try to describe them, but a\npicture is worth a thousand words - what if that one picture or actually\na photo was enough? With over 100 million offers and with multiple\nphotos for every product, this seems nearly impossible. Especially given\nhow similar some products are. During this talk, I will share how we\nmake it possible by introducing a visual search model. I will focus on\nour machine learning model and its evolution over time but also cover\nsome technical aspects of our approach.\n",
