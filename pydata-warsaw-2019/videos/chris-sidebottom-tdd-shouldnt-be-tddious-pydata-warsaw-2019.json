  "description": "An introduction to applying TDD in a Data world. Taking the experience\nof traditional TDD from a Web Development background and translating it\ninto useful techniques for Data Scientists. Hopefully by the end of this\ntalk TDD will be far less of a buzzword and you'll enjoy applying it\nmore yourself!\n\nBeginning by introducing how I learnt TDD (Test Driven Development) from\nWeb Development. I\u2019ll walk through how the traditional way of using TDD\nsometimes doesn\u2019t apply to Data Science. By exploring examples of\ndata-oriented TDD, I\u2019ll show that even though TDD is a rigorous\npractice, it can also be fun. And how TDD can provide you with more\nspace to explore how to build software.\n\nBuilding upon the data testing, we\u2019ll look at how to apply TDD to\nmachine learning models and why it\u2019s tricky to build deterministic tests\nfor them. Then we\u2019ll bring it altogether with pipeline testing, how it\ncan be difficult and ways to create tests that proxy it. I'll also cover\nwhen not to use TDD, as that can ruin the fun.\n\nBy the end of the talk, you should have ideas for implementing TDD in\nyour workflow with data. And ways to convince people to play along with\nyou!\n",
