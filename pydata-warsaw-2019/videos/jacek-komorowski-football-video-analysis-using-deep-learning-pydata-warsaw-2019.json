  "description": "The talk will present how to combine classical computer vision\ntechniques with deep learning methods to automate analysis of football\nvideos. It'll cover efficient methods for ball and player detection and\nrecognition in long shot video coverage of football games.\n\nI'll present how to combine classical computer vision techniques with\ndeep learning methods to build a solution to automate football video\nanalysis. The talk will cover using deep convolutional neural networks\nfor ball and player detection, application of multi-view stereo methods\nfor 3D ball position recovery and using Spatial Transformer Networks to\nboost accuracy of jersey number recognition classifier. I'll discuss\npractical problems arising during long shot video analysis of football\ngames. Problems, that make apparently simple tasks, like ball detection,\nreally challenging.\n",
