  "description": "We have developed a mobile application using kivy framework. It uses\nDeep Neural Networks to help segregating trashes. Thanks to this app,\nbefore throwing trash to specific bin, you will know which trash bin you\nshould throw to. Only thing you will do is just taking a photo of the\ntrash via the app.\n\nMunicipality in Gdansk started to be really strict about segregating\ntrash last year. They are checking segregating performance of\nresidential buildings and providing opportunity to pay less tax to those\npeople who live in the buildings which have better segregation\nperformance. Also, they are fining companies which don't follow the\nsegregation instructions. Even though, instructions are well defined\nstill sometimes people are confused to decide which trash bin they\nshould use. For example, empty carton of milk seems like it should go to\nthe bin for paper, but actually it should go to the bin for plastic and\nmetals.\n\nWe have realized that having a mobile app which will guide people about\nthis purpose would be very helpful. We have developed deep neural\nnetworks(DNN) using transfer learning. DNNs have been trained by using\nkeras Python library. After having good performed model, kivy app has\nbeen developed.\n\nIn this speech, we would like to talk about transfer learning, Python\nkeras library, kivy framework, obstacles we had and future plans about\nadditional features to the application.\n",
