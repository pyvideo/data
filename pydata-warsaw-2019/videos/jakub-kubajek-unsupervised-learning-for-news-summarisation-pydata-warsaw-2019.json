  "description": "With hundreds of articles published every day, it is hard to keep track\nof the main issues in the media. However, the unsupervised learning may\nhelp to identify the most relevant information.\n\nWhy should we read news sites if we can automatically extract the most\nimportant information?\n\nDuring the talk, I will present how to identify and summarise the most\nimportant topics appearing on news sites. I will cover theoretical and\npractical aspects of LexRank and other unsupervised methods that may be\nused to identify key topics in media on a particular day.\n",
