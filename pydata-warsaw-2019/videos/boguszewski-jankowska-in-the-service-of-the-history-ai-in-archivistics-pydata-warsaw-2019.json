  "description": "A trillions of old photos are a valuable source of information about the\npast. Unfortunately most of them are not described sufficiently or at\nall. Imagine Artificial Intelligence as a friend of the archivist of the\n21st century. This is the end of unlabeled photos epoch.\n\n1839 is a data generally accepted as the birth year of practical\nphotography. Since then mankind produced about 10 quadrillions of photos\nincluding 1 quadrillion only last year. This huge amount of unlabeled an\nundescribed data is a problem, if we want to obtain important\ninformation quickly and efficiently. Old photos are extremely valuable,\nbecause they contain a lot of data about the past. However some\nexpertise and experience is needed to properly describe such images.\nWhat if we include all this knowledge into neural networks? Can AI\nbecome a friend of the 21st century archivist? Let\u2019s talk about\nautomatic image tagging and faces recognition in old photos.\n",
