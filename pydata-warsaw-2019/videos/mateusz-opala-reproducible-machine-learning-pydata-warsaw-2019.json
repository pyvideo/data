  "description": "Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific methods. Especially in\nproduction Machine Learning it's crucial to ensure that hidden source of\nrandomness is not a real reason for a model performance improvement. In\nmy talk I will elaborate on importance of reproducibility and show how\nwe build reproducible machine learning pipelines at Netguru.\n\nReproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific methods. Especially in\nproduction Machine Learning it's crucial to ensure that hidden source of\nrandomness is not a real reason for a model performance improvement.\nAlthough, reproducibility in building machine learning papers seems to\nbe must-have, it's still not a standard.\n\nOutline of talk:\n\n1. Definitions:\n\n   -  reproducibility\n   -  replicability\n   -  generalisability\n\n2. Motivation for achieving reproducibility\n3. Full reproducibility == Continuous Delivery for ML\n4. Changes in ML development process\n\n   -  code\n   -  data\n   -  models\n\n5. How we managing change in ML development process?\n6. Data versioning\n\n   -  Quilt Data\n\n7. Experiments management\n\n   -  MLFlow / Polyaxon\n\n8. Summary\n",
