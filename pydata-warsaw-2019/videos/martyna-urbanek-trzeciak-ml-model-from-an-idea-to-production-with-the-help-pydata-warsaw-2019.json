We will consider every step of the process starting with the\nidea where data- driven predictions can be helpful, through data\npreparation, data modelling, communication of the results using various\nvisualizations and implementation on production including monitoring of\nmodel performance. I will mention various Python libraries that can be\nof use on each step and consider real use cases to dive deeper into some\nof the mentioned steps. During the talk I will also mention open source\nPython library for easy data access that we develop in Fandom.\n",
