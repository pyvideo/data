  "description": "Representation of text data from semi-structured log records is a\nchallenging problem that is crucial for the quality of anomaly detection\nengines. In the presentation, I will show a pipeline to create vector\nembeddings and normalization rules on semi-structured, text data that\ncould be used in anomaly detection problems.\n\nSemi-structured data such as server logs or system activity metadata is\nkey to detect cybersecurity threats or security breaches. At F-Secure,\nwe apply a variety of machine learning methods to detect anomalies in\nthe stream of semi- structured text-based events to protect our\ncustomers. However, many advanced techniques require a numerical\nrepresentation of text data (file paths, program names, command line\narguments, registry records). The most popular methods (one-hot-encoding\nand simple embeddings) do not capture the specific context and semantics\nof log data. Typically, when processing the log data, the vocabulary is\nmuch bigger than in natural languages. Moreover, we need to identify and\nnormalize randomly generated paths, temporary files, software versions\nor command-line arguments.\n\nI will present a pipeline to create vector embeddings and normalization\nrules on semi-structured data using the popular natural language\nprocessing (NLP) Word2Vec model. At the end I will show a simple anomaly\ndetection engine that uses the embeddings to find potentially malicious\nactivity. If you are interested in cybersecurity, NLP or log processing\nyou should find it appealing.\n",
