  "description": "As deep learning becoming prevalent in adoption of practical AI, it is\nimportant to lower barrier to entry for DL adoption for the developer\ncommunity. This can be done by 1) retaining and reusing existing and\npopular libraries as much as possible and employing them in development\nof DL applications, and 2) Automating model development as much as\npossible though usage open source AutoML tools.\n\nDeep Numpy enhances Numpy by adding GPU support and parallel processing\nto it, while aspiring to remain 100% numpy compatible. It enables\neasy-to-use and easy-to-extend AutoML with a focus on deep learning, and\nmaking AutoML deploy in real-world applications.\n\nIn this talk, we focus on the use of Deep Numpy and AutoGluon for rapid\ndevelopment of DL models.\n",
