  "description": "In this talk, we describe how Python in combination with Apache Spark\nhelps Avast to fight bad guys. We demonstrate different use cases how we\napply machine learning to a wide range of security applications from\nanomaly detection on time series to clustering of malicious files.\n\nAvast is dedicated to creating a world that provides safety and privacy\nfor all. Every month we stop over 1.5 billion attacks and analyze 30\nmillion new executable files. Robust big data pipelines are crucial for\nus to ensure the safety of our customers. We use Apache Spark and\nmachine learning frameworks, including TensorFlow, in different areas\nsuch as network security and malware detection and classification.\n\nIn the first part of the presentation, we describe our cluster\nenvironment and talk about how we analyze, cluster, and build\nclassification models for malicious files. Clustering by itself is\nwidely used for different security applications, and Spark enables us\nwith a fast way of conducting our experiments. The pipeline is useful\nfor the research on new algorithms and the evaluation of the production\nones.\n\nIn the second part, we show the application of anomaly detection on time\nseries. As an antivirus company, we receive thousands of different\nincident reports daily. We help malware experts to analyze threats by\nnotifying them about sudden changes. We will walk you through our\nstreaming application with parallel training and serving of multiple\nTensorFlow models.\n",
