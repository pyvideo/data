  "description": "Making the world a safer place is not rocket science, it's data science.\n\nIn the field of cybersecurity, data scientists use computational methods\nto develop more effective ways to find security threats hidden in data\nflows of IT network communications. This talk, focused on data\nscientists, will provide a moderately technical representation of how\nmachine learning and data science solve real-life problems,\ndemonstrating how threat detection is enriched and improved through\nmachine learning and data science.\n\nI will address:\n\n-  The ups and downs of AI and ML in this application: What\u2019s so\n   complicated about cybersecurity anyway? \\* Machine Learning taxonomy:\n   classification, clustering, anomaly detection\n-  When is an anomaly an anomaly, and when is it not an anomaly?\n-  How we built Machine Learning spaceships to identify one of the\n   oldest and most persistent attack vectors (i.e. SQL Injections): Big,\n   Bigger, and the Biggest versions.\n-  Trade-off with accuracy and complexity: Do we need to destroy a\n   planet to get rid of SQL injections?\n",
