  "abstract": "The most common perception around the term UX writing is that it only\nincludes microcopy for the user interfaces. However, that is not\ncorrect. Writing snappy messages on the UI is only a part of it; more\nimportant aspect is developing a voice for the product and imbibing that\nvoice in your content (UX, help, knowledge base, etc).\n\nThis talk covers some of the necessary skills required for being good at\nUX writing and how these skills help us in designing a better product\nexperience. Whether be it the decision of keeping the tone professional\nvs casual or using title case vs sentence case, decisions must be taken\nbased on the audience and should always be in-context.\n\nAnd yea, one last thing, technical writers are/can be great UX writers!\n",
