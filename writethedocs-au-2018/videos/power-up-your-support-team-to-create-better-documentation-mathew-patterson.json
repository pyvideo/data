  "abstract": "Software support teams are in a tough spot. They know documentation is\nimportant, and they love to refer customers to it, but finding time to\nactually write and maintain those documents is *really* hard.\n\nThat endless support queue and its ceaseless demand for attention mean\nthat documentation is too often ignored. Mat shares his hard earned\npractical advice to help technical writers and support team knowledge\nbase owners create a more effective documentation system.\n\nLearn why documentation falls behind, how to reduce support writing\nfriction and how other SaaS teams have made support an engine for great\ndocumentation.\n",
