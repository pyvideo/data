  "abstract": "I\u2019ll walk through how my team and I create an information experience\nthat feels human, helpful, and how we know if it\u2019s successful. Part of\nthat experience bridges the information gap between the messages you\nreceive before you log into an Atlassian product and the messages you\nreceive in the form of:\n\n-  Introductory states\n-  Blank states\n-  Directional and instructive text in the app\n-  UI copy and it's connection to user expectations and perceptions\n-  Documentation and how it supports different functional journeys\n\nWe\u2019ll cover how working ahead of time with our marketing, content, and\nbrand teams allows us to know and influence user expectations throughout\ntheir early journey. We\u2019ll also talk about how far we have yet to go.\n",
