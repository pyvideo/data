  "description": "Most industries have had what we might call an oh-no moment. It's those\nmoments that encourage industries to become better regulated, in order\nto prevent further disasters. The IT industry has had many moments that\ncould be considered consequential enough to encourage better regulation,\nbut the changes have never been made. Because the industry has avoided\neffective regulation for so long, it is possible that we are hurtling\ntowards a disaster of epic proportions, one that we haven't even managed\nto conceive of yet.\n\nIn this talk, I will go through some historical examples of disasters\nleading to regulation in other industries, and the measures that were\nput into place to mitigate the problem. I will also address some of the\nmajor moments from the IT industry that should have prompted regulation,\nand haven't. Finally, I will discuss ways that documentation\nprofessionals are uniquely placed to identify, and potentially blow the\nwhistle on, potential disasters before they happen.\n",
