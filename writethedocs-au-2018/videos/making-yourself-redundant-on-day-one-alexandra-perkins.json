  "description": "The first few weeks at a new job are hard. There seem to be too many\nquestions and not enough answers, and so much assumed knowledge about\nthe company you joined and the products they make.\n\nI\u2019m going to talk about how you can make those first few weeks your most\nproductive and valuable to your new company. By writing internal\ndocumentation that answers all the questions only someone new on the\nblock knows to ask, you can help pave the way for new hires in the\nfuture, and even help identify and solve customer pain points.\n\nDrawing from my own experiences working as an intern and support agent\namong highly technical teams, I will go over deciding what to document\nbased on the level of technical proficiency you would expect the reader\nto have, how to use tone to convey the company\u2019s spirit and keep a\nfuture reader interested, and how to future-proof your internal\ndocumentation so it doesn\u2019t stop being updated when you move on.\n",
