  "abstract": "As many documentation teams move towards a docs-as-code workflow, most\nare turning to static site generators like Jekyll, Sphynx, Hugo, or\nGitBook to turn that 'code' into user-facing documentation websites. In\nthis mini- workshop, you'll get an introduction to the static site\ngenerator landscape, and apply what you learn by publishing your own\nsite in class. We'll cover:\n\n-  How static site generators work\n-  Comparison of popular generators, with guidelines for choosing one\n   for your next project\n-  Hands-on editing and publishing of your own statically generated\n   portfolio website\n",
