  "description": "You have to write some docs. To do this, you need information from other\npeople.\n\nExcept that they're too busy, or in another office, or another timezone,\nor they just don't want to help. What do you do?\n\nThis talk will look at the psychology behind why we often don't get the\nhelp we ask for, how we can work with what we've got, and ways we can\nget information out of unwilling participants, in spite of themselves!\n",
