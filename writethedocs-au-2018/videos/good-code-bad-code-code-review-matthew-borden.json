  "description": "Code review is the duty of every developer in a team. We are the guards\nof the mystical \u201cgood\u201d code and defenders against evil technical debt.\nIt\u2019s universally agreed that it\u2019s easy to spot \u201cbad\u201d code and much\nharder to determine \u201cgood\u201d code.\n\nI\u2019m going to share some of my experiences working on a team producing a\nlarge amount of code every day, with few reviewers. We\u2019ll dive into\nlooking for smart architectural and design decisions, coherently\nunderstanding what problem the author intended to solve and\nunderstanding how they implemented a solution.\n\nI\u2019ll touch on automating away the most common issues within Code Review\nand pulling the technical brains out of your team mates into great\ndocumentation. Most importantly we\u2019ll talk about the human side of code\nreview and how to manage code review within large and small teams. Code\nreview helps our teams grow institutional knowledge and shared\nunderstanding of the systems we build together. A strong understanding\nof how to review code will help you to write better code and help you\nhelp your teammates to write better code.\n",
