  "description": "Statistically Efficient Greedy Equivalence Search\n\nMax Chickering (Microsoft)*\n\nWe establish the theoretical foundation for statistically efficient variants of the Greedy Equivalence Search algorithm. If each node in the generative structure has at most $k$ parents, we show that in the limit of large data, we can recover that structure using greedy search with operator scores that condition on at most $k$ variables.  We present simple synthetic experiments that compare a backward-only variant\nof the new algorithm to GES using finite data, showing increasing benefit of the new algorithm as the complexity of the generative model increases.",
