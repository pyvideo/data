  "description": "\"Deriving Bounds And Inequality Constraints Using Logical Relations Among Counterfactuals\n\nNoam Finkelstein (Johns Hopkins University)*; Ilya Shpitser (Johns Hopkins University)\n\n  Causal parameters may not be point identified in the presence of unobserved\n  confounding. However, information about non-identified parameters, in the form\n  of bounds, may still be recovered from the observed data in some cases. We\n  develop a new general method for obtaining bounds on causal parameters using\n  rules of probability and restrictions on counterfactuals implied by causal\n  graphical models. We additionally provide inequality constraints on\n  functionals of the observed data law implied by such causal models. Our\n  approach is motivated by the observation that logical relations between\n  identified and non-identified counterfactual events often yield information\n  about non-identified events. We show that this approach is powerful enough to\n  recover known sharp bounds and tight inequality constraints, and to derive\n  novel bounds and constraints.\"",
