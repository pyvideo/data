  "description": "\"Optimal Statistical Hypothesis Testing for Social Choice\n\nLirong Xia (RPI)*\n\nWe address the following question in this paper: \u201cWhat are the most robust statistical methods for social choice?\u201d By leveraging the theory of uniformly least favorable distributions in the Neyman-Pearson framework to finite models and randomized tests, we characterize uniformly most powerful (UMP) tests, which is a well-accepted statistical optimality w.r.t. robustness, for testing whether a given alternative is the winner under Mallows\u2019 model and under Condorcet\u2019s model, respectively.\"",
