  "description": "How Private Are Commonly-Used Voting Rules?\n\nAo LIU (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute); Yun Lu (University of Edinburgh)*; Lirong Xia (RPI); Vassilis Zikas (University of Edinburgh)\n\nDifferential privacy has been widely applied to provide privacy guarantees by adding random noise to the function output. However, it inevitably fails in many high-stakes voting scenarios, where  voting rules are required to be deterministic. \nIn this work, we present the first framework for answering the question:\nHow private are commonly-used voting rules? \nOur answers are two-fold. First, we show that deterministic voting rules provide sufficient privacy in the sense of distributional differential privacy (DDP). We show that assuming the adversarial observer has uncertainty about individual votes, even publishing the histogram of votes achieves good DDP. Second, we introduce the notion of exact privacy to compare the privacy preserved in various commonly-studied voting rules, and obtain dichotomy theorems of exact DDP within a large subset of voting rules called generalized scoring rules.",
