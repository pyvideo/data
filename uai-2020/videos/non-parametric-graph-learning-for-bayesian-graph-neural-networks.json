  "description": "\"Non Parametric Graph Learning for Bayesian Graph Neural Networks\n\nSoumyasundar Pal (McGill University)*; Saber Malekmohammadi (Huawei Noah's Ark Lab); Florence Regol (McGill University); Yingxue Zhang (Huawei Technologies Canada); Yishi Xu (Mila); Mark Coates (McGill University)\n\nGraphs are ubiquitous in modelling relational\nstructures. Recent endeavours in machine learning\nfor graph structured data have led to many\narchitectures and learning algorithms. However,\nthe graph used by these algorithms is often\nconstructed based on inaccurate modelling\nassumptions and/or noisy data. As a result, it\nfails to represent the true relationships between\nnodes. A Bayesian framework which targets\nposterior inference of the graph by considering\nit as a random quantity can be beneficial. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel non-parametric\ngraph model for constructing the posterior distribution\nof graph adjacency matrices. The proposed\nmodel is flexible in the sense that it can\neffectively take into account the output of graph\nbased learning algorithms that target specific\ntasks. In addition, model inference scales well\nto large graphs. We demonstrate the advantages\nof this model in three different problem settings:\nnode classification, link prediction and\nrecommendation.\"",
