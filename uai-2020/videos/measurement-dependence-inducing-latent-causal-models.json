  "description": "\"Measurement Dependence Inducing Latent Causal Models\n\nAlex Markham (University of Vienna)*; Moritz Grosse-Wentrup (University of Vienna)\n\nWe consider the task of causal structure learning over measurement dependence inducing latent (MeDIL) causal models. \nWe show that this task can be framed in terms of the graph theoretic problem of finding edge clique covers,resulting in an algorithm for returning minimal MeDIL causal models (minMCMs). \nThis algorithm is non-parametric, requiring no assumptions about linearity or Gaussianity. \nFurthermore, despite rather weak assumptions aboutthe class of MeDIL causal models, we show that minimality in minMCMs implies some rather specific and interesting properties. \nBy establishing MeDIL causal models as a semantics for edge clique covers, we also provide a starting point for future work further connecting causal structure learning to developments in graph theory and network science.\"",
