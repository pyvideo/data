  "description": "Skewness Ranking Optimization for Personalized Recommendation\n\nYu-Neng Chuang (National Chengchi University); Chih-Ming Chen (National Chengchi University); Chuan-Ju Wang (Academia Sinica)*; Ming-Feng Tsai (National Chengchi University)\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel optimization criterion that leverages features of the skew normal distribution to better model the problem of personalized recommendation. Specifically, the developed criterion borrows the concept and the flexibility of the skew normal distribution, based on which three hyperparameters are attached to the optimization criterion. Furthermore, from a theoretical point of view, we not only establish the relation between the maximization of the proposed criterion and the shape parameter in the skew normal distribution, but also provide the analogies and asymptotic analysis of the proposed criterion to maximization of the area under the ROC curve. Experimental results conducted on a range of large-scale real-world datasets show that our model significantly outperforms the state of the art and yields consistently best performance on all tested datasets.",
