  "description": "\"Graphical continuous Lyapunov models\n\nGherardo Varando (University of Copenhagen)*; Niels Richard Hansen ()\n\nThe linear Lyapunov equation of a covariance matrix parametrizes the\nequilibrium covariance matrix of a stochastic process. This parametrization can\nbe interpreted as a new graphical model class, and we show how the model class\nbehaves under marginalization and introduce a method for structure learning via\n$\\ell_1$-penalized loss minimization. Our proposed method is demonstrated to\noutperform alternative structure learning algorithms in a simulation study, and\nwe illustrate its application for protein phosphorylation network reconstruction.\n\"\n\"",
