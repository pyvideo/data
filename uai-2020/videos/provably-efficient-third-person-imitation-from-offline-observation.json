  "description": "\"Provably Efficient Third-Person Imitation from Offline Observation\n\nAaron Zweig (New York University)*; Joan Bruna (Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, NYU, USA)\n\nDomain adaptation in imitation learning represents an essential step towards improving generalizability.  However, even in the restricted setting of third-person imitation where transfer is between isomorphic Markov Decision Processes, there are no strong guarantees on the performance of transferred policies.  We present problem-dependent, statistical learning guarantees for third-person imitation from observation in an offline setting, and a lower bound on performance in the online setting.\"",
