  "description": "PyData Berlin 2016\n\nFragDenStaat.de is a website that helps people to make freedom of information requests in Germany. Starting in 2011, they collected over 12000 of these requests. Using pandas and matplotlib, I tried to bring life into this interesting data set.\n\nMotivation\n\nFragDenStaat.de offers an API with which you can scrape more than 12000 public freedom of information requests. Each request contains information about: when it was sent, to which public body and to which jurisdiction it was sent, how long it took the public body to complete the request, whether the request was successful and if not, why so. Visualizing all these aspects of the data set might lead to new insights about this transparency process.\n\nData preparation\n\nHow I scraped the data set and organized it using pandas.\n\nData visualization\n\nHow I visualized the data set using pandas and matplotlib.\n\nVisualizations\n\nThe results of my work so far.\n\nMaterials available here: https://github.com/awakenting/fds-statistics",
