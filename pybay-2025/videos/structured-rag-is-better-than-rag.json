  "description": "At Microsoft I've been contributing to an open source project demonstrating what we call Structured RAG. This is an improvement over the popular AI tactic named RAG (look it up) that can answer questions over large collections of text or images better and faster than RAG. We use this as the basis for long-term AI memory.I will explain the Structured RAG algorithm and show some demos with real-world data. I will also discuss the Python library we are releasing this summer and its API.\n\nFor more information, see https://pybay.org/\n\nFollow us on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/company/pybay",
