  "description": "In late May, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced CS majors ranked 7th in unemployment at 6.1%. With the scarcity of openings for interns and new grads relative to previous years, internships are now more important than ever. Join me in highlighting the value of interns to the company, mentor, mentee, and industry as a whole with an example using Python with Pandas and Matplotlib. The talk will also show the benefits of interns both immediate and after the internship experience.",
