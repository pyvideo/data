  "description": "I'm a big fan of AI-assisted coding tools\u2014they\u2019re making programming more accessible than ever! But as developers, we risk using LLMs to write everything, including our tests, and forgetting the powerful tools in our Python testing toolbox.In this talk, I\u2019ll explore where AI-generated tests can fall short\u2014and show how writing your own tests leads to more robust, meaningful coverage.You\u2019ll leave with a sharper instinct for when to lean on AI\u2014and when to reach for more specialized tools.",
