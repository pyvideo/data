  "description": "Hello World is often used as a stand-in for \"the simplest program\", great for teaching and getting people started on their coding journey. But what _really_ happens in that one line? This talk will be a deep dive into the Python interpreter, C libraries, Linux kernel, and beyond. We will poke holes in every abstraction and learn about our computers like never before, both to aid in debugging and to pick the best level of tooling for future development projects.\n\nFor more information, see https://pybay.org/\n\nFollow us on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/company/pybay",
