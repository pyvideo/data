  "description": "Meta has some of the largest typed Python codebases in the world. That\u2019s why we built Pyre and now Pyrefly. Despite this, Meta has lots of untyped code and we have been building tooling to help add types at scale. This talk will explore the benefits of typed Python, how to increase types in your codebase and leverage new tools like Pyrefly to improve developer experience in large Python codebases.",
