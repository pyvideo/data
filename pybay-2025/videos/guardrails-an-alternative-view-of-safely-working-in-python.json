  "description": "Python \u2013 like many languages \u2013 lets you do dangerous things. Many of features that allow you to do inadvisable things were used to achieve things that since became defining features of Python.Python \u2013 unlike many languages \u2013 discovered that leaving these features lying next to dangerous things was a bad idea, and built guardrails around them.In this talk, we\u2019ll explore this design philosophy, and use that to explain Python\u2019s attitude to safely working with the language and its internals.\n\n\nFor more information, see https://pybay.org/\n\nFollow us on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/company/pybay",
