  "description": "In the medallion data architecture, the bronze layer is for staging incoming raw data before further transformation and cleaning. Ideally, tabular CSV data undergoes minimal transformations and is queryable upon ingestion; however, third party data sources can contain unstable schema that make this challenging even using pandas. With native Python data structures and a more flexible data schema, such this messy data can more reliably be ingested for cleaning and monitoring.\n\nFor more information, see https://pybay.org/\n\nFollow us on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/company/pybay",
