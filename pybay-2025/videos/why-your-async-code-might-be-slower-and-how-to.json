  "description": "Asyncio has become one of Python\u2019s most popular libraries for writing fast, scalable applications. But sometimes, using async can actually make programs slower.This talk explores common asyncio mistakes, how misunderstanding I/O-bound vs. CPU-bound tasks hurts performance, and practical patterns for writing efficient async code.Through real-world examples and live demos, you\u2019ll leave with a clear model for using asyncio effectively.\n\nFor more information, see https://pybay.org/\n\nFollow us on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/company/pybay",
