  "description": "It's the 20th anniversary of PEP 343! Context managers have been part of Python since 2005, but they're still as useful as ever. In this entertaining talk, we'll explore why context managers exist, how they work, when to reach for them, and how they synergize with the contextvars module. Whether you're a beginner or a veteran Pythonista, you're sure to learn something new. And, thanks to context managers, you can rest assured that this talk won't leak any open file handles.\n\n\nFor more information, see https://pybay.org/\n\nFollow us on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/company/pybay",
