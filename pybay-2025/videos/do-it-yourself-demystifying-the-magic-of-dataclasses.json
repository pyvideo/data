  "description": "Python's built-in `dataclasses` module provides an enormous amount of leverage when defining classes: minimal code can enable maximal capabilities. However, inevitably, the `@dataclass` decorator will fall short of your needs as a program grows over time and gains complexity. This talk will walk through how to build the most important features of `dataclasses` yourself so you'll know what to do. It will also investigate the advanced techniques `dataclasses` uses under the hood to make it work.",
