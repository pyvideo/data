Every\ncompany, big or small want to make most of the technology available to\nthem. One such niche technology is GPU computing. If used cautiously can\nsave a lot of computing efforts and time across the applications.\nBusiness, with the boom in Machine learning/Deep learning techniques,\nare on the way to leverage this technology in their day to day work.\nHere, I present to you a real-time application on how GPU can save\ncomputing efforts and reduce the computation time from 2 days to 20\nseconds. The talk will cover the best case scenarios and use case for\nthe GPU implementing for recommendations at scale. The talk will start\nwith the overview of the problem at hand, comparing CPU and GPU\nprocessing time and best fit to utilize GPU for the task in hand or any\nother scenario.\n\nFor those, interested in delving into the detailed code utilized for the\nsame, here\u2019s the link to my blog containing the same,\nhttps://medium.com/walmartlabs/how-gpu-computing-literally-saved-me-at-work-\nfc1dc70f48b6\n",
