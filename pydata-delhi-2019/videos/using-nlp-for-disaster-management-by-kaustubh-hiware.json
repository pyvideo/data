  "description": "During disasters, it is extremely crucial that the right resources are\nreceived to the victims within time. Disaster relief NGO's revealed that\nthere is often mismanagement and lack of coordination. Also, often\nidentifying right resources takes up a lot of crucial time. To aid this,\nwe developed an algorithm that identifies locations from microblogs,\nupto 100x faster than SoTA StanfordNLP.\n\nWe first developed an algorithm to identify location from microblogs in\na real time situation, which was 100 times faster than state of the art\nStanfordNLP. The proposed algorithm is also faster than other tools. We\nused NLP tools like dependency paring, Named Entity Recognition, and\nother rules to identify the location. This resulted into a research\npaper at WWW2018, WebConf held at France. To further assist disaster\nrelief attempts, we developed a platform that could identify crucial\ninformation like Resources, location, quantity etc thus effectively\nusing social media to aid disaster mitigation. The proposed platform\nemerged first in Microsoft's code.fun.do Hackathon out of 242\nparticipants, and was one of 21 student projects to be demonstrated on a\nnational level at Microsoft's AXLE, 2019.\n",
