  "description": "This talk presents a systematic approach to improve model lifecycle\nmanagement for machine learning models, using Python/DevOps tools and\nprocesses to enable self-served model development and deployment; a\nfour-step workflow guides the developer/modeler to develop, automate,\ntest and implement the model in a virtual environment in a\nproduction-ready manner.\n\nStatistical/machine-learning modeling is often subject to regulatory\nmandates on model development, validation, deployment and monitoring.\nThese mandates are liable to require that production models are\nfit-for-purpose, are accurately implemented and obey with local laws and\nregulations. However in many environment complying with such mandates is\nextremely onerous and time consuming, e.g. due to the use of legacy\ntechnologies and workflows or unstructured model development by data\nscientists.\n\nThis talk presents a systematic approach to this challenge, using\nPython/DevOps tools and processes to enable self-served model\ndevelopment and deployment; a four-step workflow guides the modeler to\ndevelop, automate, test and implement the model in a virtual environment\nin a production-ready manner. The approach is in use by the Quantitative\nAnalytics team at Barclays bank, but we believe that the issues and\npotential solutions are relevant to the other regulated industries.\n",
