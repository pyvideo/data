  "description": "Now that we're familiar with the famous iris dataset, let's actually use a classification model in scikit-learn to predict the species of an iris! We'll learn how the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) model works, and then walk through the four steps for model training and prediction in scikit-learn. Finally, we'll see how easy it is to try out a different classification model, namely logistic regression.\n\nThis is the fourth video in the series, `Introduction to machine learning with scikit-learn <http://www.dataschool.io/machine-learning-with-scikit-learn/>`__. The notebook and resources shown in the video are available on `GitHub <https://github.com/justmarkham/scikit-learn-videos>`__.",
