  "description": "In this video, we'll cover the data science pipeline from data ingestion (with pandas) to data visualization (with seaborn) to machine learning (with scikit-learn). We'll learn how to train and interpret a linear regression model, and then compare three possible evaluation metrics for regression problems. Finally, we'll apply the train/test split procedure to decide which features to include in our model.\n\nThis is the sixth video in the series, `Introduction to machine learning with scikit-learn <http://www.dataschool.io/machine-learning-with-scikit-learn/>`__. The notebook and resources shown in the video are available on `GitHub <https://github.com/justmarkham/scikit-learn-videos>`__.",
