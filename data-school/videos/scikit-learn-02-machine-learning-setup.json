  "description": "Want to get started with machine learning in Python? I'll discuss the pros and cons of the scikit-learn library, show how to install my preferred Python distribution, and demonstrate the basic functionality of the IPython Notebook. If you don't yet know any Python, I'll also provide four recommended resources for learning Python.\n\nThis is the second video in the series, `Introduction to machine learning with scikit-learn <http://www.dataschool.io/machine-learning-with-scikit-learn/>`__. The notebook and resources shown in the video are available on `GitHub <https://github.com/justmarkham/scikit-learn-videos>`__.",
