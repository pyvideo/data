  "description": "We've learned how to train different machine learning models and make predictions, but how do we actually choose which model is \"best\"? We'll cover the train/test split process for model evaluation, which allows you to avoid \"overfitting\" by estimating how well a model is likely to perform on new data. We'll use that same process to locate optimal tuning parameters for a KNN model, and then we'll re-train our model so that it's ready to make real predictions.\n\nThis is the fifth video in the series, `Introduction to machine learning with scikit-learn <http://www.dataschool.io/machine-learning-with-scikit-learn/>`__. The notebook and resources shown in the video are available on `GitHub <https://github.com/justmarkham/scikit-learn-videos>`__.",
