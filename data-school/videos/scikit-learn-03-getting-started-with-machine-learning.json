  "description": "Now that we've set up Python for machine learning, let's get started by loading an example dataset into scikit-learn! We'll explore the famous \"iris\" dataset, learn some important machine learning terminology, and discuss the four key requirements for working with data in scikit-learn.\n\nThis is the third video in the series, `Introduction to machine learning with scikit-learn <http://www.dataschool.io/machine-learning-with-scikit-learn/>`__. The notebook and resources shown in the video are available on `GitHub <https://github.com/justmarkham/scikit-learn-videos>`__.",
