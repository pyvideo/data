  "description": "GitHub is migrating its public API system from REST to GraphQL. In this\ntalk, I'd like to go over my personal experiences writing API\ndocumentation for ten years, and why GraphQL's \"everything needs\ndocumentation\" approach is a much needed improvement. I'd go over past\nAPI tooling and methodologies, current best practices to make \"sane\"\nautogenerated API documentation, and why I think that GraphQL is a boon\nfor technical writers, developers, and end users.\n",
