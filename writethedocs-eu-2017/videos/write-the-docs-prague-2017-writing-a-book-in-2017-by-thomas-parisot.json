  "abstract": "The usual way of writing a technical book is to open the Word or\nLibreOffice application, to write some content, to make a backup, to\nsend it by email to the publisher and to deal with the feedbacks. And\nrepeat.\n\nHowever in 2017 we can do differently by using open formats like\nAsciidoc, by using version control to propagate changes, by using\ncollaborative platforms like GitHub or GitLab to collate feedbacks in\nany form as well as transforming text and code into readable and\ninteractive artefacts.\n\nIt gives us a unique opportunity to approach the whole process of\nwriting in term of \"content experience\", of \"toolchain\" and of\n\"distribution\".\n\nIn the end, a \"book\" becomes a \"writing format\" as we can reuse the same\npattern to manage any kind of \"content\" \u2014 articles, publications,\nessays, documentation \u2014 that we can transform in physical books,\ne-books, interactive web pages etc.\n",
