  "description": "For 22+ years, I am working in IT \u2013 most of this time in the \u201cbusiness-\nrelated\u201d part of the game. Roughly a year ago, I decided to change\nsomething. Well \u2013 still working in IT, and still working in the same\ncompany \u2026 But I moved from a Product Marketing role (which I hold for\nabout 17 years) to R&D, because the documentation team \u201cmade me an offer\nI couldn\u2019t refuse\u201d.\n\nOf course I interacted with many of our engineers before, and of course\nI also knew most of the documentation team members before. But in\nretrospective, I can say that I somehow lived on \u201canother planet\u201d\nbefore, and that my first year as documentarian in an open source\nsoftware company was definitely deeply eye-opening for me.\n\nIf you are curious now, join the talk and hear more about my main\ntakeaways regarding documentation in general and the experiences with my\nteam in particular.\n",
