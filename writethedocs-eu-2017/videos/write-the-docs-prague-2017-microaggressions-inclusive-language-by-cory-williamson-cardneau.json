  "abstract": "You've heard about diversity problems in tech, right? We know the\nproblem exists at every point in the process: education, internship\nopportunities, hiring. We don't talk much about what happens to the\npeople we *do* work with.\n\nAs documentarians, we spend a lot of time thinking about the best words\nto use for our products, tutorials, manuals. We know that words matter.\n\"Microaggressions\" are the small indignities that people of color,\nnon-cis- gendered folks, women, and others experience on a daily basis.\nMicroaggressions at work tell us, over and over, that we don't really\nbelong in that workplace. So let's talk about the words we use with our\ncoworkers. Let's talk about how we can all make diversity a daily\npractice at work, not just a hiring problem.\n",
