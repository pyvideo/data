  "description": "Created in 2016, Tech Writers Without Borders aims to connect technical\ncommunicators with nonprofits seeking help with their documentation and\ntraining materials.\n\nUsing examples from our work with iNERDE, a social enterprise seeking to\nempower West African youth with Science, Technology, Engineering and\nMath education, I will describe the many ways in which technical\ncommunicators can make a real difference to the operational\neffectiveness of nonprofits and the lives of those they serve.\n\nIf you, too, are interested in volunteering your skills for social\nimpact, this session will hopefully inspire you to action, or, at the\nvery least encourage you to view the value of your craft in a new light.\n",
