  "abstract": "As the old saying goes, \u201cyou never get a second chance to make a first\nimpression\u201d. When you first meet someone new (not least at a conference\nfor documentarians!), those first few moments set the tone. In exactly\nthe same way, the experience your user has when they first \u201cmeet\u201d your\nproduct and get to grips with it will set the tone for your entire\nrelationship with them.\n\nAs documentarians, we so often focus on building detailed and exhaustive\n\u201creference\u201d documentation, but in doing that, we forget to provide the\nright kind of \u201cgetting started\u201d experience for a user brand new to our\nproduct.\n\nAt GoCardless, we spent the first years of the life of our platform\nfocused on building high-quality reference documentation. But in Summer\n2016, we kicked off a big piece of work on a new set of resources: a\n\u201cgetting started\u201d guide for our API, getting the user from\nnought-to-sixty on our developer platform.\n\nTo make the right first impression, we had to turn things on their head\nand think from the reader\u2019s perspective. From this perspective, what\nwe\u2019ll write and build looks very different to our \u201creference\u201d\ndocumentation, seeking not only to teach the user how to use our\nproduct, but also to explain the fundamental concepts behind it and to\nbring the user to the all-important \u201caha!\u201d moment where they see the\nvalue in what we\u2019re offering.\n\nIn this talk, I\u2019ll go through:\n\n-  the fundamental differences between \u201creference\u201d and \u201cgetting started\u201d\n   documentation\n\n-  the lessons we learnt on the way as we experimented and spent\n   extensive time with end users\n\n-  what we built\n\n-  the results \u2014 from our users\u2019 perspective, and in terms of how we\n   build demand within the company for further \u201cgetting started\u201d content\n",
