  "description": "Any doc - every doc - that you deliver, it's only as useful as the\nrequirements it satisfies. Typical requirements revolve around target\naudience, method of delivery, technical limitations. But after the doc\nis done, then come unexpected expectations.\n\nSuddenly, your docs should not only make users happy, but also help your\nstakeholders achieve their aims - move up a career ladder, impress the\nboss, get a bigger paycheck.\n\nThe success of your docs depends on things you are never told. This talk\nis about reading your stakeholders and deducing the ultimate\nrequirements.\n",
