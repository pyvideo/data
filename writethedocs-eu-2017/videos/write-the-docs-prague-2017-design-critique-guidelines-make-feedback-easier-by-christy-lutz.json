  "abstract": "Getting feedback on your work is a necessary part of any project, and it\nmakes your output stronger and more diverse. But it can be hard when\nyour work is being evaluated. Sometimes, it feels like your reviewers\nhave a deep and abiding interest in pain. You\u2019ll never succeed! Well,\nyou have already succeeded just by asking for feedback. Together, we\u2019ll\ndiscuss how to build up your tolerance for taking that feedback.\n\nFeedback became so much easier for me when I learned design critique\nguidelines from a co-worker and UX Designer. Design critique guidelines\nare a set of rules and practices that can make getting and giving\nfeedback easier. After presenting this speech at the Write the Docs\nPortland 2017 conference, I received a ton of great feedback on it. Now,\nI have even more strategies to share so that you can implement design\ncritique guidelines into your own review process to make feedback\npainless.\n",
