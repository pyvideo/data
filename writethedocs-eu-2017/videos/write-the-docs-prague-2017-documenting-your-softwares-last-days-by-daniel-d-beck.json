  "description": "It could happen to you: your project is canceled, your team is\n\u201creorganized\u201d, or your company is closing its doors. Some or all of your\nsoftware, service, or API may not be long for this world. What will you\nsay to the people using your software? In this talk, you\u2019ll learn how to\navoid a communications disaster when it\u2019s time to break bad news to your\nusers.\n\nWhether you\u2019re deprecating significant features or shutting down\nentirely, you still have a chance to make life better\u2014or at least a\nlittle less worse\u2014for the people who have come to rely on your work. In\nthis talk, you\u2019ll learn how to:\n\n-  plan your shutdown communications to make sure no users get left\n   behind\n\n-  let your users down easy with the appropriate voice, tone, and\n   content\n\n-  cope with a stressful situation\n\nFrom your initial announcement to your service\u2019s last day, you\u2019ll learn\nhow to say goodbye in a way that\u2019s good for you and your\nsoon-to-be-former users.\n",
