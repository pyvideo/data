  "abstract": "In this presentation I will explore other ways to communicate concepts\nbeyond words to show that documentation needn't just be about technical\nwriting.\n\nIn the first part of the presentation I will briefly cover theories and\nprinciples behind forms of communication and what documentarians can\nlearn from them. Topics such as:\n\n-  Portraying meaning in images: Iconography, maps, manuals\n\n-  Non-verbal conversation: Body language, ways of speaking\n\n-  Fidelity: Sketch notes, simplicity, style\n\nDuring each of these topics I will present in the style of the topic, so\nexpect something a little different.\n\nIn the second practical part of the presentation I will take elements of\nthe theory and applying them practically. I will start by looking at\nscreenshots and diagrams. When and how to use them, what they should\nshow, and how to manage them.\n\nThen I'll cover taking screenshots to the next level with animated gifs\nand screen recordings that show clear user flows and expected results.\n\nFinally in this part of the presentation I will cover interactive\ndocumentation, and the options for allowing readers to directly\nmanipulate and experiment with documentation and directly see inputs and\noutputs.\n\nIn summary, our work typically appears on one of the most dynamic\nplatforms (the web) that has ever existed, let's all do more with it!\n",
