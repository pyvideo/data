  "description": "Crowdsourcing is an increasingly attractive practice that is being used\nto develop documentation. When well designed, this approach increases\ndocumentation velocity and reduces bottlenecks. However, there are (at\nleast) two huge challenges:\n\n-  Keeping documentation quality high\n\n-  Ensuring that content gets developed in line with the products and\n   services it supports\n\nWhile no doc set will ever be perfect, there is hope for overcoming\nthese challenges. In this talk, I'll share lessons learned from working\nthrough these challenges at companies of various sizes. We'll walk\nthrough content management best practices, including:\n\n-  Setting occasional authors up for success\n\n-  Building an effective writing toolkit\n\n-  Defining content management strategies for globally distributed teams\n",
