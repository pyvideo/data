  "description": "(A replacement for REST?)\n\nEd Singleton\n\nSaturday 15th, 12:00 (Room D)\nA talk (25 minutes)\n\nGraphQL is a recent specification that is a good replacement for REST APIs. It is flexible and gives frontend developers a high degree of control over what data they get back. It allows much faster iteration, with less negotiation between front and backend developers, and requiring significantly less upfront planning.\n\nIt has been used to great success at Facebook, Khan Academy, GitHub and many other developer led companies.\n\nThis talk will give a brief overview of GraphQL. Followed by a deeper dive into Python support for it through the Graphene library. It will show how GraphQL can be easily integrated into Django and Flask webframeworks, and be automatically reflected from Django ORM or SqlAlchemy.",
