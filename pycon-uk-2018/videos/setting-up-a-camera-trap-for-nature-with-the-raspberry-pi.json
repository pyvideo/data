  "description": "Take incredible snaps of the wildlife in your garden or school\nJody Carter\n\nSaturday 15th, 12:30 (Assembly Room)\nA talk (25 minutes)\nI was annoyed and frustrated with the cost of setting up a video stream of nature at school. It can be a couple of hundred pounds to set up a live bird box. A wonderful resource but can be prohibitively expensive for schools, so I had a go at doing it myself. I decided to set up some camera traps using a few Raspberry Pi computers and I was really amazed at how easy it was and how brilliant the results where. It turns out I have badgers at the bottom of my garden! I now have several set up including an auto tweeting camera on a bird feeder (@pibirdbrain) and a few at school including a pond cam where we've managed to get some really great and close up pics of tadpoles and newts.\n\nI want to show others how easy it is to get going (you don't need to be an expert), that it's really cheap and fantastic fun.\n\nThe speaker suggested this session is suitable for teachers.",
