  "description": "Introduction to Neural Networks\n.. Emma Gordon\n  \nAssembly Room 2018-09-18 15:30-16:00\nTrack: pydata\n  \nSo, you keep hearing about neural networks. Perhaps you've even gone to a talk or two, but are still wondering exactly how a neural network works, what you'd use one for and how to get started. This talk has you covered.\n\nWe'll illustrate the basic concepts by walking through implementing a neural network from scratch in Python, and then move on to the powerful real world libraries you'd use in production.\n\nThis session is aimed at programmers of all experience levels who are newcomers to the subject of neural networks. If you're already using them as part of your work, there will likely be nothing new for you here.",
