  "description": "PyData Amsterdam 2016\n\nOne of the most exciting areas in data science is the development of new predictive applications; apps used to drive product recommendations, predict machine failures, forecast airfare etc. These applications output real-time predictions and recommendations in response to user and machine input to directly derive business value and create cool experience.\n\nThe most interesting apps utilize multiple types of data (tables, graphs, text & images) in a creative way. In this talk, we will show how to quickly build and deploy a predictive app that exploits the power of combining different data types together using GraphLab Create, our open source based Python software.\n\nSlides available here: http://www.slideshare.net/PyData/danny-bickson-python-based-predictive-analytics-with-graphlab-create",
