  "summary": "Everybody Loves Migrations\n\nWednesday 2:45 p.m.--3:30 p.m.\n\nAudience level: Intermediate\n\nDescription\n\nTimes are changing - schema migrations are finding their way into core\nDjango and becoming quite different in the process. Come and learn\nwhat's happening, why it's being done this way, and how you can best\nstart using them. Abstract\n\nThis year has seen a lot of changes on the migration front. After a\nsuccessful Kickstarter, schema migrations have been finding their way\ninto core Django, and they're not quite the South migrations you're used\nto.\n\nDon't worry though - behind every one of the new features or changes is\nfive years of learning and experimentation, and this is where you can\ncome and hear not only what's new and how best to use it, but also why\nit was done that way and the challenges that came up as part of it.\n\nAmong other topics, this should cover squashing, branch merge detection,\ncustom fields, using raw SQL and data migrations with Python code.\n",
