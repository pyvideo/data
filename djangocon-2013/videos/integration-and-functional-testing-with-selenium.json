  "summary": "INTEGRATION AND FUNCTIONAL TESTING WITH LIVESERVERTESTCASE, SELENIUM AND\nMORE\n\nThursday 2:45 p.m.--3:30 p.m.\n\nAudience level: Intermediate\n\nDESCRIPTION In this talk, I will present LiveServerTestCase, a feature\nrecently added to Django to enable new, comprehensive forms of testing.\nI will in particular show how to use LiveServerTestCase with browser\nautomators like Selenium to perform integration and functional tests for\nyour Django applications.\n\nABSTRACT The Django ecosystem has always placed a strong emphasis on\ntesting, partly thanks to a wide range of tools available in Django's\nown testing framework. One of the most used from those tools is the\ndummy web client, which allows to emit mock HTTP requests directly to\nyour codebase and to inspect the responses' contents. However, as useful\nas it is, this dummy client is limited as it does not exercise the full\nHTTP specification and it cannot effectively reproduce actual user\ninteractions. With the recent introduction of LiveServerTestCase, it is\nnow possible to use sophisticated HTTP libraries like python-requests\nand browser automators like Selenium to perform your tests in a more\ncomprehensive way. By automatically running a live HTTP server in the\nbackground, LiveServerTestCase allows you to write tests ensuring that\nall layers of your web application properly fit together and that user\ninteractions function well from end to end.\n\nThis talk will cover a range of topics to help you get started with the\nwriting of integration and functional tests for your Django\napplications, including:\n\nA brief history of when and how LiveServerTestCase was added to Django\ncore. A brief review of different browser automators (Selenium,\nGhost.py, etc.). Tips for writing, accelerating and debugging Selenium\ntests. Testing interactive Javascript-based front-ends and user\nworkflows. A demo of the Django core Selenium test suite. Testing\nRESTful APIs with python-requests. Running Selenium tests in headless\nmode for continuous integration. Thoughts on when to use, and when not\nto use, integration and functional tests.\n",
