  "summary": "Trial by Fire: real world performance optimization\n\nTuesday 12:15 p.m.--1 p.m.\n\nAudience level: Intermediate\n\nDescription\n\nYour site is slow. But why is your site slow? There are a myriad of\ndifferent problems that can cause this slowness. Drawn from real world\nexperiences, this talk will help identify different problem areas and\ntechniques for increasing performance. This involves both evaluating\nyour performance on the backend and understand bottlenecks on the\nfrontend. Abstract\n\nThis talk is will share with the audience our experience of improving\npage load performance on a site. Performance evaluation is a scary\nthing, especially for the inexperienced. This talk is not purely a \"How\nto Optimize Django\" as it will discuss various aspects of what makes a\nsite appear slow to the end user.\n\nWhat is slow? - How to identify where the problem and where to start\n\nPerformance Evaluation: - Django performance evaluation through\nmiddleware and debug toolbar - Browser performance evaluation through\nfirebug, chrome developer toolkit, and third party tools, etc.\n\nPerformance Enhancement: - Reducing SQL queries - Leveraging server-side\ncaching - fragment caching - lower level caching - using a database\nconnection pooler - asset compression - CDN for media delivery - ajax\npage loading - message queues\n",
