  "description": "Dask is a pure Python library for parallel and distributed computing. Last year Dask parallelized NumPy and Pandas computations on multi-core workstations. This year we discuss using Dask to design custom algorithms and execute those algorithms efficiently on a cluster. This talk discusses Pythonic APIs for parallel algorithm development as well as strategies for intuitive and efficient distributed computing. We discuss recent results in machine learning and novel scientific applications.",
