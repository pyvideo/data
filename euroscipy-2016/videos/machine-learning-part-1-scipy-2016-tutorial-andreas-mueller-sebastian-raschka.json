  "description": "This tutorial aims to provide an introduction to machine learning and scikit-learn \"from the ground up\". We will start with core concepts of machine learning, some example uses of machine learning, and how to implement them using scikit-learn. Going in detail through the characteristics of several methods, we will discuss how to pick an algorithm for your application, how to set its parameters, and how to evaluate performance.\n\nTutorial materials found here: https://github.com/amueller/scipy-2016-sklearn\n\nSee the complete SciPy 2016 Conference talk & tutorial playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYx7XA2nY5Gf37zYZMw6OqGFRPjB1jCy6",
