  "description": "GR is a plotting package for the creation of two- and three-dimensional graphics in Python or Julia, offering unique plotting functions to visualize static or dynamic data with minimal overhead. In addition, GR can be used as a backend for other plotting interfaces or wrappers, in particular when being used in interactive notebooks. This presentation shows how visualization applications with special performance requirements can be designed on the basis of simple and easy-to-use functions as known from the MATLAB plotting library. Using quick practical examples, this talk is going to present the special features and capabilities provided by the GR framework both as a self-contained graphics library or as a fast backend for other packages.
