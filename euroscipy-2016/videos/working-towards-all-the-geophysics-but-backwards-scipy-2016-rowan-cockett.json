  "description": "Geophysical inversions are tools for constructing models of the subsurface (images) given a finite amount of data. SimPEG (http://simpeg.xyz) is an effort to synthesize geophysical forward and inverse methodologies into a consistent framework. We will show seven geophysical methods based around a diamond exploration case study, combining the results to drive a more informed decision.
