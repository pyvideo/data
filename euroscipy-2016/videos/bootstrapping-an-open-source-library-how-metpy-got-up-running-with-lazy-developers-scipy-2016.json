  "description": "MetPy is an open-source Python package for meteorology, providing domain-specific tools for reading data, performing calculations, and visualizing data that we have recently started developing actively. In order to keep code working and in good shape, and minimize the accrual of technical debt, the project developers have focused on making use of many cloud services to automate the development of the project. These services accomplish: static code analysis, continuous integration testing, automated documentation builds, and automated releases. We will present our experiences of how these services have helped with development, as well as challenges that presented themselves, with the goal to encourage others to use those to support their own development efforts.\n\nSlides for this talk are here: https://github.com/metpy/MetPy/blob/master/talks/MetPy%20Infrastructure%20-%20SciPy%202016.pdf\n\nSee the complete SciPy 2016 Conference talk & tutorial playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYx7XA2nY5Gf37zYZMw6OqGFRPjB1jCy6",
