  "description": "We theoretical physicists love paper and blackboard, but computational analysis is also a good friend of us. I will guide through my journey during a project in string theory, from the formulation of a physics problem toward building a Python program with a web front-end, hoping that this will illustrate how theoretical physicists interested in Python programming and Python developers interested in physical and mathematical science can help each other.",
