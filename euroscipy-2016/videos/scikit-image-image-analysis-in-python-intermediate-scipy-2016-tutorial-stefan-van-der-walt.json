Despite a deep appeal to human intuition, gaining understanding of image content remains challenging, and often relies on heuristics. Even so, the wealth of knowledge contained inside of images cannot be understated.\n \n Scikit-image is an image processing library, built on top of SciPy, that provides researchers, practitioners, and educators access to a strong foundation upon which to build algorithms and applications.\n \n In this tutorial, aimed at intermediate users of scientific Python, we introduce the library, give practical, real-world examples of applications, and briefly explore its use in the context of machine learning. Throughout, attendees are given the opportunity to learn through hands-on exercises.\n \n Prerequisites: a working knowledge of NumPy arrays.",
