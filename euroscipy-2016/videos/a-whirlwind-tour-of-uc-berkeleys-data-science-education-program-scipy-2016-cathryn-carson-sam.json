This presentation will provide an overview of the program, focusing on the Python-based Foundations of Data Science (DATA 8, http://data8.org/) course aimed at any and all freshmen. This material will be of interest to diverse folks thinking about data science education, using Jupyter notebooks in the classroom, and/or deploying and scaling JupyterHub. In this presentation, we\u2019ll highlight student-facing content and provide an overview of our JupyterHub deployment. All these materials are publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/data-8/). The slides for this talk are available at http://bit.ly/berkeley-ds-scipy-2016\n\nSee the complete SciPy 2016 Conference talk & tutorial playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYx7XA2nY5Gf37zYZMw6OqGFRPjB1jCy6",
