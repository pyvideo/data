  "description": "Materials for this tutorial may be found here: https://github.com/enthought/Numpy-Tutorial-SciPyConf-2016\n\nThis course introduces the fundamental concepts for numerical calculation with NumPy. It provides scientists, engineers, and analysts a solid foundation for writing their own analyses and simulations in Python. \n NumPy provides Python with a powerful array processing library and an elegant syntax that is well suited to expressing computational algorithms clearly and efficiently. We'll introduce basic array syntax and array indexing, review some of the available mathematical functions in numpy, and discuss how to write your own routines. Along the way, we'll learn just enough of matplotlib to display results from our examples.\n\nMore info on HDBSCAN here: https://github.com/lmcinnes/hdbscan. \n\nSee the complete SciPy 2016 Conference talk & tutorial playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYx7XA2nY5Gf37zYZMw6OqGFRPjB1jCy6",
