  "description": "Conduit (http://software.llnl.gov/conduit) is a new open source project from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. It provides an intuitive model for describing hierarchical scientific data in C++, C, Fortran, and Python. Conduit supports in-core data coupling between packages, serialization, and I/O tasks. \n \nConduit leverages ideas from JSON and NumPy to provide a cross-language data access API that simplifies sharing data in the HPC ecosystem. For SciPy 2016, an important focus of our talk will be Python support in Conduit and how positive experiences using Python motivated our approach to build a sane cross-language data description solution.",
