  "description": "The Mission Analysis, Operations, and Navigation Toolkit Environment (MONTE) is the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPL) signature astrodynamic computing platform. It was built to support JPL's deep space exploration program, and has been used to fly robotic spacecraft to Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Ceres, and many solar system small bodies. At its core, MONTE consists of low-level astrodynamic libraries that are written in C++ and presented to the end user as an importable Python language module. These libraries form the basis on which Python-language applications are built for specific astrodynamic applications, like trajectory design and optimization, orbit determination, flight path control, and more. This talk gives a brief history of the project, shows some examples of MONTE in action, and relates the stories of its greatest successes.",
