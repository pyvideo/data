  "description": "This talk showcases SymPy\u2019s code generation capabilities. SymPy is a Python library that enables symbolic manipulation of mathematical expressions. Code generation is useful across a wide variety of domains. SymPy supports generating code for C, Fortran, Matlab/Octave, Python, Julia, Javascript, LLVM, Rust, and Theano. The code generation system is easily extensible to any language. Code generation supports a wide variety of expressions, including matrices. Code generation allows users to deal only with the high level mathematics of a problem, avoids mathematical errors and typos, makes it possible to deal with expressions that would otherwise be too large to write by hand, and opens possibilities to perform mathematical optimizations of expressions. SymPy\u2019s code generation is used by libraries such as PyDy, chemreac, and sympybotics.",
