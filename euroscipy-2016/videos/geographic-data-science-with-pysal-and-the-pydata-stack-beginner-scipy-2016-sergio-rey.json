  "description": "Tutorial materials may be viewed at http://darribas.org/gds_scipy16/\nInstallation instructions are found at http://darribas.org/gds_scipy16/content/infrastructure/\n\nThis two-part tutorial will first provide participants with a gentle\n introduction to Python for geospatial analysis, and an introduction to version PySAL 1.11 and the related eco-system of libraries to facilitate common tasks for Geographic Data Scientists. \n The first part will cover munging geo-data and exploring relations over space. This includes importing data in different formats (e.g. shapefile, GeoJSON), visualizing, combining and tidying them up for analysis, and will use libraries such as `pandas`,\n `geopandas`, `PySAL`, or `rasterio`. The second part will provide a gentle overview to demonstrate several techniques that allow to extract geospatial insight from the data. This includes spatial clustering and regression and point pattern analysis, and will use libraries such as `PySAL`, `scikit-learn`, or `clusterpy`.",
