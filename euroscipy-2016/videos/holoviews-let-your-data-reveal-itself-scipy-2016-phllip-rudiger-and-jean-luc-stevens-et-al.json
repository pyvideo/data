  "description": "Data exploration typically involves code for analyzing and\n transforming a dataset together with separate code\n used for visualization. This back and forth between tools\n provides a serious bottleneck to getting a real grasp of the\n data. In this talk we will demonstrate how the HoloViews library\n lets you wrap datasets of any complexity and size,\n making the data instantly visualizable in Jupyter Notebooks \n to allow interactive exploration via widgets and various plotting\n backends including matplotlib and bokeh.",
