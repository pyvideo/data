  "description": "Our aim in this talk is to present the new features available in the next major version of Spyder, the Scientific PYthon DEvelopment EnviRonment. This version (Spyder 3.0) represents almost two years of development and brings important characteristics that we would like to introduce to the SciPy community. Among them we can find: the ability to\n create and install third-party plugins, improved projects support, syntax highlighting and code completion for all programming languages supported by Pygments, a new file switcher\n (similar to the one present in Sublime Text), code folding for the Editor, Emacs keybindings for the entire application, a Numpy array graphical builder, and a fully dark theme for the interface.",
