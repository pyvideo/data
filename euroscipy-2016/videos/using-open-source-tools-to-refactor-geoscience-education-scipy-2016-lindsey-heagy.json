  "description": "How do we communicate fundamental concepts in a reproducible, actionable form? How do we put numerical simulation tools in the hands of undergraduate students? These are questions we have been exploring in the development of GeoSci.xyz, a web-based resource in geophysics that leverages the geophysical software package SimPEG, Sphinx documentation, Jupyter notebooks and Binders to make examples and explanations that are reproducible and interactive.\n\nSlides are available here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MYbVAWG6YyoC9uNK7EydAEX3INcAUG28bGYzOFG0lp4/edit?usp=sharing\n\nSee the complete SciPy 2016 Conference talk & tutorial playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYx7XA2nY5Gf37zYZMw6OqGFRPjB1jCy6.",
