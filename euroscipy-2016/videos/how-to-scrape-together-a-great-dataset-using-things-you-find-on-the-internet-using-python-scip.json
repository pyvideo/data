  "description": "Using Jupyter notebooks and scikit-learn, you\u2019ll predict whether a movie is likely to win an Oscar or be a box office hit. I\u2019ll walk through the most important steps of creating an effective dataset using information that you find on the Internet: asking a question your data can answer, writing a web scraper, and answering those questions using nothing but Python libraries and data from the Internet.
