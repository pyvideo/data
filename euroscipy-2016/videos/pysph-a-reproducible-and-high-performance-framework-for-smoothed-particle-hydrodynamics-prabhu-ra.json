  "description": "SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics) is a general purpose technique to numerically compute the solutions to partial differential equations. The method is grid-free and uses particles to discretize the various properties of interest. The method is Lagrangian and particles are moved with the local\n velocity. The method was originally developed for astrophysical problems (compressible gas-dynamics) but has since been extended to simulate incompressible fluids, solid mechanics, free-surface problems and a variety of other problems.\n \n The SPH method is relatively easy to implement. This has resulted in a large number of schemes and implementations proposed by various researchers. It is often difficult to reproduce published results due to the variety of implementations. While a few standard packages like (SPHysics, DualSPHysics, JOSEPHINE etc.) exist, they are usually tailor-made for particular applications and are not general purpose.\n \n Our group has been developing PySPH (http://pysph.bitbucket.org) over 5 years. PySPH is open source, and distributed under the new BSD license.",
