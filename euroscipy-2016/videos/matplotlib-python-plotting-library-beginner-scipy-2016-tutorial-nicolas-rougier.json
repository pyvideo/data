  "description": "Materials to follow along with the tutorial may be found at http://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/teaching/matplotlib/matplotlib.html and here github.com/rougier/matplotlib-tutorial \nAfter reviewing the main concepts for scientific figures creation (based on the \"Ten simple rules for better figures\" article), we will experience specifically the matplotlib library that provides many different types of high-quality figures with only a few lines of code. We'll go through the creation of a simple, but carefully crafted figure and see in the meantime the main concepts of the library. Then, we'll go through an animation example showing the last 50 earthquakes on the planet and we'll finish the tutorial with a set of exercises showing the main type of plots. Last, we'll have a look at available resources for advanced uses.\n\nSee the complete SciPy 2016 Conference talk & tutorial playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYx7XA2nY5Gf37zYZMw6OqGFRPjB1jCy6",
