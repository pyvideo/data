  "description": "Proposal link: https://pretalx.com/euroscipy-2023/talk/EX3C7K/\n\nNumPy is one of the foundational packages for doing data science with Python. It enables numerical computing by providing powerful N-dimensional arrays and a suite of numerical computing tools. In this tutorial, you'll be introduced to NumPy arrays and learn how to create and manipulate them. Then, you'll see some of the tools that NumPy provides, including random number generators and linear algebra routines.",
