  "description": "Proposal link: https://pretalx.com/euroscipy-2023/talk/CJCV9W/\n\nSolara is a pure Python web framework designed to scale complex applications. Leveraging a React-like API, Solara offers the scalability, component-based coding, and simple state management that have made React a standard for large web applications. Solara uses a pure Python implementation of React, Reacton, to create ipywidgets-based applications that work both in the Jupyter Notebook environment and as standalone web apps with frameworks like FastAPI. This talk will explore the design principles of Solara, illustrate its potential with case studies and live examples, and provide resources for attendees to incorporate Solara into their own projects. Whether you're a researcher developing interactive visualizations or a data scientist building complex web applications, Solara provides a Python-centric solution for scaling your projects effectively.",
