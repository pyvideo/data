  "description": "Proposal link: https://pretalx.com/euroscipy-2023/talk/3ENHXR/\n\nHave you ever wondered what type of data you can get about a certain location on the globe? What if I told you that you can access an enormous amount of information while sitting right there at your laptop? In this talk, I'll show you how to use Google Earth Engine to enrich your dataset. Either your exploring, or planning your next ML project, Geospatial data can provide you with a lot of information you did not know you had access to. Let me show you how!",
