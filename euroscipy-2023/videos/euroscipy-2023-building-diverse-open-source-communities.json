  "description": "Proposal link: https://pretalx.com/euroscipy-2023/talk/ZNFWD3/\n\nToday state of the art scientific research as well as industrial software development strongly depend on open source libraries. The demographic of the contributors to these libraries is predominantly white and male. In order to increase participation of groups who have been historically underrepresented in this domain PyLadies Berlin, a volunteer run community group focussed on helping marginalised people to professionally establish themselves in tech, has been running hands on monthly open source hack nights for more than a year. After some initial challenges the initiative yielded encouraging results. This talk summarises the learnings and teaches how they can be applied in the wider open source community.",
