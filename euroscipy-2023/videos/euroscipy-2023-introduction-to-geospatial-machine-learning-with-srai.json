  "description": "This tutorial offers a thorough introduction to the srai library for Geospatial Artificial Intelligence. Participants will learn how to use this library for geospatial tasks like downloading and processing OpenStreetMap data, extracting features from GTFS data, dividing an area into smaller regions, and representing regions in a vector space using various spatial features. Additionally, participants will learn to pre-train embedding models and train predictive models for downstream tasks.",
