  "description": "Proposal link: https://pretalx.com/euroscipy-2023/talk/UBT8PH/\n\nThis talk will discuss the importance of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) principles in the development of scientific applications, with a focus on creating robust and reproducible code that can withstand rigorous testing and scrutiny. The presentation will cover best practices for project structure and code organization, as well as strategies for ensuring reproducibility, collaboration, and managing dependencies. By implementing CI/CD principles in scientific application development processes, researchers can improve efficiency, reliability, and maintainability, ultimately accelerating research.",
