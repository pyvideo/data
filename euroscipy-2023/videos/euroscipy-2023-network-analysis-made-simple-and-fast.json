  "description": "Through the use of NetworkX's API, tutorial participants will learn about the basics of graph theory and its use in applied network science. Starting with a computationally-oriented definition of a graph and its associated methods, we will build out into progressively more advanced concepts (path and structure finding). We will also discuss new advances to speed up NetworkX Code with dispatching to alternate computation backends like GraphBLAS. This will be a hands-on tutorial, so stretch your muscles and get ready to go through the exercises!",
