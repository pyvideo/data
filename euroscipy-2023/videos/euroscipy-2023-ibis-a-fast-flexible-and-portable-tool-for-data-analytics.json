  "description": "Proposal link: https://pretalx.com/euroscipy-2023/talk/HCATHS/\n\nIbis provides a common dataframe-like interface to many popular databases and analytics tools (BigQuery, Snowflake, Spark, DuckDB, …). This lets users analyze data using the same consistent API, regardless of which backend they’re using, and without ever having to learn SQL. No more pains rewriting pandas code to something else when you run into performance issues; write your code once using Ibis and run it on any supported backend. In this tutorial users will get experience writing queries using Ibis on a number of local and remote database engines.",
