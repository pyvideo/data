  "description": "Zarr is an API and cloud-optimized data storage format for large, N-dimensional, typed arrays, based on an open-source technical specification. In the last 4 years it grew from a Python implementation to a large ecosystem. In this talk, we want to share how this transformation happened and our lessons learned from this journey. Today, Zarr is driven by an active community, defined by an extensible specification, has implementations in C++, C, Java, Javascript, Julia, and Python, and is used across domains such as Geospatial, Bio-imaging, Genomics and other Data Science domains.",
