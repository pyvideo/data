  "description": "Could scikit-learn future be GPU-powered ? This talk will discuss the performance improvements that GPU computing could bring to existing scikit-learn algorithms, and will describe a plugin-based design that is being foresighted to open-up scikit-learn compatibility to faster compute backends, with special concern for user-friendliness, ease of installation, and interoperability.",
