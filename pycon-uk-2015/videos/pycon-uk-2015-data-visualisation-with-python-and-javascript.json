  "description": "To accompany an upcoming O'Reilly book 'Data-visualisation with Python\nand Javascript: crafting a dataviz toolchain for the web' (see here)\nthis talk aims to sketch out the toolchain by transforming some dry\nWikipedia data (Nobel prize-winners) into a far more engaging and\ninsightful web- visualisation. This transformative cycle uses Python\nbig-hitters such as Scrapy, Pandas and Flask, the latter delivering data\nto Javascript's D3. These are the industrial lathes of the toolchain but\nPython's fantastic standard library and all those first class\ndata-munging libraries are involved, the spanners, hammers and\nscrewdrivers of the toolchain.\n\nWhile Python is fast becoming the goto language for\ndata-processing/science, the visual fruits of that labour hit the wall\nof the web, where there is only one first-class language, Javascript. To\ndevelop a data-viz toolchain for the modern world, where\nweb-presentation is increasingly mandated, making Python and Javascript\nplay nicely is fundamental. This talk aims to show that the perceived\nwall between the two languages is actually a thin, permeable membrane\nand that, with a bare minimum of web-dev, one can get on with\nprogramming seamlessly in both.",
