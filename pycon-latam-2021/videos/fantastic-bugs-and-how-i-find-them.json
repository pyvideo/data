  "description": "I build open-source testing tools, like Hypothesis and Pytest and I've seen some fascinating bugs. Join me for a tour of the best, and we'll explore why bugs happen, my 'property-based' tricks for finding them, and how to prevent them. If, of course, the weird behaviour really is a bug!",
