  "description": "Luciano is part of our global Learning & Development team, building programs and platforms to help Thoughtworkers master new technologies. He was hired as a developer in 2015, right after releasing Fluent Python -- a best-selling O'Reilly book published in seven languages so far.\n\nAs a developer with Thoughtworks, Luciano has worked on different client projects using Python, Node.js, and Ruby (so far), in different domains. The work he's done has often been related to IoT applications collecting data and/or controlling equipment deployed in the field.\n\nLuciano is passionate about programming language design and applications, and is constantly looking at emerging languages to understand and spread the word about the most compelling business use cases for them. Currently he is focusing on Go and Elixir, besides Python. For the second year in a row, he is the curator of the \"Languages of The 21st Century\" track for the QCon São Paulo conference.\n\nA firm believer in self-directed learning, Luciano co-founded Garoa Hacker Clube, a hackerspace in São Paulo, Brazil, the mega-city where he lives and works when he is not visiting different Thoughtworks offices or speaking at conferences around the world.",
