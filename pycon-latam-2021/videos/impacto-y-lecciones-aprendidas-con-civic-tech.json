  "description": "\nI'm a software developer from Puerto Rico living in Washington DC.\n\nOver the years I've worked in Puerto Rico as a consultant and developer while contributing to the creation of a couple of tech communities in the San Juan metro area. The latest being Fullstack Nights and Code for Puerto Rico\n\nIn 2016 I moved to Washington DC to join the United States Digital Service. Afterwards I stayed in the city to join Code.gov as a tech lead and later GitHub where I helped the Dept. of Veterans Affairs in their digital transformation.\n\nI'm currently working with Uplight, Inc. as a senior engineer on their platform team, where we are building the APIs to help transform the energy industry.\n\nWhile essentially a blog, I'm going to be using this space as a place to record thoughts, ideas, and have a place where I can save things that I don't want to forget. You'll see posts in English, Spanish, and \"Spanglish\".\n\nThanks for being here and I hope you enjoy this ride with me.",
