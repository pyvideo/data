  "description": "Learning to code is seen as a new literacy akin to learning a second\nspoken language - but is it? In this talk I'll explore my experiences\nlearning French and Python and examine some of the common themes between\nboth fields. Together we'll dismantle the myth that adults cannot learn\nas well as children and explore what it really means to be *fluent*.\nFinally, we'll explore immersion based learning and look at how it might\nhelp us become better Python programmers.\n",
