  "description": "Your users have entrusted their data to you. But what happens when a law enforcement government agency demands you share the data with them? We will demystify the process of receiving and responding to law enforcementâ€™s demands for data. We demonstrate how designing around privacy can limit what needs to be shared. To make subpoenas less scary, we break them down as a technical process, and share the protections we implemented at Mozilla. If you want to understand the real-world impact of your approaches to privacy, this talk is for you.",
