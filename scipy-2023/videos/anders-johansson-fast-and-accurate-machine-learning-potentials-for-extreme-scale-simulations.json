  "description": "Allegro and FLARE are two very different packages for constructing machine learning potentials that are fast, accurate, and suitable for extreme-scale molecular dynamics simulations. Allegro uses PyTorch for efficient equivariant potentials with state-of-the-art accuracy, while FLARE is a sparse Gaussian process potential with an optimized C++ training backend leveraging Kokkos, OpenMP, and MPI for state-of-the-art performance, and a user-friendly Python frontend. We will compare and contrast the two methods, discuss lessons learned, and show spectacular scientific applications.\n\n----\n\nSciPy is a community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through open source Python software for mathematics, science, and engineering. The annual SciPy Conference allows participants from all types of organizations to showcase their latest projects, learn from skilled users and developers, and collaborate on code development. SciPy is organized by NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that promotes open source scientific computing.",
