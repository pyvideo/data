  "description": "This talk will discuss how Numba was used to accelerate MCViNE, a software environment for building and running digital twins of neutron experiments via Monte Carlo ray tracing. Numba is an open-source JIT compiler for Python using LLVM to generate efficient machine code for CPUs and GPUs with NVIDIA CUDA. Python and Numba were used to create a GPU accelerated version of MCViNE utilizing an extensible object-oriented design that has achieved a speedup of up to 1000x over the CPU. The performance gain with Numba enables more sophisticated data analysis and impacts neutron scattering science and instrument design.",
