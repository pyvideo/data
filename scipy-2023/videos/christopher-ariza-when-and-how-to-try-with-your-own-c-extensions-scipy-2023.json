  "description": "While the NumPy C API lets developers write C that builds or evaluates arrays, just writing C is often not enough to outperform NumPy. NumPy's usage of Single Instruction Multiple Data routines, as well as multi-source compiling, provide optimizations that are impossible to beat with simple C. This presentation offers principles to help determine if an array-processing routine, implemented as a C-extension, might outperform NumPy called from Python. A C-extension implementing a narrow use case of the np.nonzero() routine will be studied as an example.",
