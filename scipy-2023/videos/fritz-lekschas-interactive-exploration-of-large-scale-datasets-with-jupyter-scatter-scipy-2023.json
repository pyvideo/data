  "description": "Jupyter-scatter is a scalable, interactive, and interlinked scatter plot widget for exploring datasets with up to several million data points. It focuses on data-driven visual encodings and offers two-way pan+zoom and lasso interactions. Beyond a single instance, jupyter-scatter can compose multiple scatter plots and synchronize their views and selections. Moreover, points can be connected by spline-interpolated lines. Thanks to the underlying WebGL rendering engine, spatial and color changes are smoothly transitioned. Finally, the API integrates seamlessly with Pandas DataFrames and offers functional methods that group properties by type to ease accessibility and readability.",
