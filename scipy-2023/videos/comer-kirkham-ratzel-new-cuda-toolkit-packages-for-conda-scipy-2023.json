  "description": "In this talk, we will examine the new CUDA package layout for Conda (as included in conda-forge). Show how CUDA components have been broken out. Share how this affects development and package building. Walk through changes in the conda-forge infrastructure made to incorporate these new packages. Examine recipes using the new packages and what was needed to update them. Additionally will provide guidance on how to use these new packages in recipes or in library development.",
