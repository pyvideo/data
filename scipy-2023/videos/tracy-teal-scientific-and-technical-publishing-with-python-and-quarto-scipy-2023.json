  "description": "In research and data science, effective communication requires weaving together narrative text and code to produce elegantly formatted output. By embedding executable Python code blocks inside markdown, the open-source publishing platform, Quarto, works with Jupyter and VS Code to enable you to create these fully reproducible documents and reports with the format and styling you need. In this talk Iâ€™ll share how to get started and a few of my favorite things in Quarto including creating a manuscript, presentation and website in HTML, PDF and Word from a single source file, and creating lessons, reports, and Confluence documents.",
