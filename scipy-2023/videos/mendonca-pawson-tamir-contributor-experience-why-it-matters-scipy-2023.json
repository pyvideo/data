  "description": "Behind every successful open source project is a strong contributor community. What makes these communities strong? What can you do in your OSS project to nurture a thriving contributor community? In this presentation, we will share insights from the work of the Contributor Experience Lead team (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and pandas) and discuss why designing and providing positive contributor experience is vital to sustainability of each individual project and the SciPy ecosystem overall.",
