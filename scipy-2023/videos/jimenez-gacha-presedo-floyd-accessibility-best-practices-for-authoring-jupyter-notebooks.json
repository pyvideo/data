  "description": "So you’ve written the perfect notebook, but do you know who can read it? As a notebook author you have great stories, code, and visualizations filling your work, but how often do you consider accessibility? Jupyter notebooks seem like they are for everyone, but how a notebook gets written can greatly impact how usable it is for people with disabilities. We’ve curated authoring-focused best practices for notebook content to help your notebooks be more inclusive and reach a wider audience.",
