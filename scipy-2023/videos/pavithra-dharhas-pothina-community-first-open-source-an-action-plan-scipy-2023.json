  "description": "Communities are at the heart of open source software and are fundamental to our projects’ long-term success. The Python ecosystem has several mature projects, that have spent years working on community initiatives. Newer projects can learn from their experiences and build stronger foundations to foster healthy communities.\n\nIn this talk, we share a set of practices for community-first projects, including repository management, contributor pathways, and governance principles. We’ll also share real examples from our own journey transitioning a company-backed OSS project, Nebari (https://nebari.dev/), to be more community-oriented.",
