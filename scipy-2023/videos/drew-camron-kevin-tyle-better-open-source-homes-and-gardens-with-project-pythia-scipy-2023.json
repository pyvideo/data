  "description": "As scientists continue to embrace the Jupyter ecosystem for constructing computational narratives of their science through code, data, and rich text, they may encounter technical and community barriers to maintaining and sharing their science with new and existing audiences. We demonstrate the value of open-source science community building and getting there through reliance on the open-source Jupyter ecosystem, pre-packaged GitHub and BinderHub-based infrastructure, and documentation for creating, sharing, testing, and maintaining Pythia Cookbooks for their computational narratives.",
