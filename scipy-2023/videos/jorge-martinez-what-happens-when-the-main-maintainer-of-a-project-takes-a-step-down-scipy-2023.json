  "description": "Once a maintainer of a project decides to step down of a project, the community needs to quickly adapt to this decision. This situation can be devastating for small projects and lead to their extinction. This talk demonstrates, based on the case of poliastro, that the community is a key factor for a software to survive no matter who is leading it.",
