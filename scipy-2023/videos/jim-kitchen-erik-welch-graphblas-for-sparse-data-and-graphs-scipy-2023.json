  "description": "GraphBLAS solves graph problems using sparse linear algebra. We are using it to build graphblas-algorithms, a fast backend to NetworkX. python-graphblas is faster and more capable than scipy.sparse for both graph algorithms and sparse operations. If you have sparse data or graph workloads that you want to scale and make faster, then this is for you. Come learn what makes GraphBLAS special--and fast!--and how to use it effectively.",
