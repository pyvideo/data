  "description": "napari is an n-dimensional image viewer for Python. If youâ€™ve ever tried plt.imshow(arr) and made Matplotlib unhappy because arr has more than two dimensions, then napari might be for you! napari will gladly display higher-dimensional arrays by providing sliders to explore additional dimensions. But napari can also: overlay derived data, such as points, segmentations, polygons, surfaces, and more; and annotate and edit these data, using standard data structures like NumPy or Zarr arrays, allowing you to seamlessly weave exploration, computation, and annotation in image analysis.",
