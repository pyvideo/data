  "description": "https://github.com/fastplotlib/fastplotlib\n\nFast interactive visualization remains a considerable barrier in analyses pipelines for large neuronal datasets. Here, we present fastplotlib, a scientific plotting library featuring an expressive API for very fast visualization of scientific data. Fastplotlib is built upon pygfx which utilizes the GPU via WGPU, allowing it to interface with modern graphics APIs such as Vulkan for fast rendering of objects. Fastplotlib is non-blocking, allowing for interactivity with data after plot generation. Ultimately, fastplotlib is a general purpose scientific plotting library that is useful for the fast and live visualization and analysis of complex datasets.",
