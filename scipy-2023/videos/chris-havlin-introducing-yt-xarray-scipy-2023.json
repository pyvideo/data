  "description": "yt_xarray is a new package in the scientific python ecosystem for linking yt and xarray. yt, primarily used in computational astrophysics, has gradually broadened support for scientific domains, including geoscience disciplines. Most geoscience data, however, still requires manual steps to load into yt. yt_xarray, a new xarray extension, aims to streamline communication of data from xarray to yt, providing a potentially useful tool to the many geoscience researchers already using xarray while allowing yt to leverage the distributed backends already supported by xarray. In this presentation, we will provide an overview of the usage and design of yt_xarray.",
