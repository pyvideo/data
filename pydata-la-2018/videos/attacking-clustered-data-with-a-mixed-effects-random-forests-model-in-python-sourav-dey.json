  "description": "PyData LA 2018\n\nClustered data is all around us. The best way to attack it? Mixed effect models. Sourav will explain the use cases of MERF, how the mixed effects random forests model marries the world of classical mixed effect modeling with modern machine learning algorithms, and how it can be extended to be used with other advanced modeling techniques like gradient boosting machines and deep learning.\n\n---\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
