  "description": "PyData LA 2018\n\nNot only is there an abundance of textual data, there is also an abundance of tools help analyse this data - and it is tough to choose the right tool for the right task. In this workshop we will be dealing with the entire text analysis process - this means we'll start with finding data, set up a pipeline to clean our text, annotate it, and then have it ready to do some more advanced analysis.\n\nRepo - https://github.com/bhargavvader/personal/tree/master/notebooks/text_analysis_tutorial\n---\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
