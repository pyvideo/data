  "description": "In StackOverflow's 2022 annual survey of 16,000 developers worldwide, 10.6% of respondents reported being affected by concentration or memory challenges, such as having Attention Deficit Hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and 4.3% of respondents self-identified as having an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). These results indicate that on a team of 20 engineers, up to 3 people on the team may have what are called \"neurodivergent\" brains.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of ADHD and ASD?
