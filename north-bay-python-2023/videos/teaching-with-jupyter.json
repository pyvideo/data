  "description": "Jupyter has a well-deserved reputation for being a research tool. The same properties that make it well suited for research make it a powerful tool for hands-on teaching. Whether it is abstract math, computer science, software development, physics, or many other subjects, Jupyter can be a powerful tool for teaching with integrated hands-on exercises.\n\nThe talk will show how JupyterLab can be used both for assigning independent work as well as to help follow along with traditional frontal teaching. It will cover concrete examples from math, software development, and physics, to show how to put it into practice.\n\nThe talk will also cover how to export Jupyter notebooks in a way suitable for students to download them and how to use Jupyter to grade work assigned as notebooks.",
