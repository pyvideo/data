  "description": "Come listen to the tale of how I and a small team of Scout Leaders developed and delivered a weekend course that took 11-15-year-old young adults from knowing almost nothing about networking or code, to being able to follow along and build their own website, complete with static HTML, CSS, and then transitioning to a simple Python Flask app, requiring nothing more than a web browser and Visual Studio Code on the student computers.\n\nI'll cover how we gave each student full root access to their own \"server\", through to how we built the course material to be a manageable learning curve over such a tight timeline, the challenges we faced with content delivery, and ideas for improvements before we run our next course.",
