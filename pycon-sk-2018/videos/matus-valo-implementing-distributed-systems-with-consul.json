  "description": "Developing distributed systems is hard. Implementing distributed system from scratch requires knowledge of specialized algorithms and programming techniques. Consul is distributed system which enables us to build distributed system only by using Consul HTTP API. In our presentation, we are going to show basic concepts of consul, building our own consul cluster and showing how consul can be used for implementing distributed system. Our discussion will include also showing how we can benefit from consul even when using already existing python distributed components.",
