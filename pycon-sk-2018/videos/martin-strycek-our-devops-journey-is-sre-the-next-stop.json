  "description": "Over past few years we see significant raise in technology requirements, complexity of managing and delivering high reliability systems. Based on our first-hand experience we see that there does not exist one silver bullet way of doing DevOps and way how you manage Continuous Delivery features. At Kiwi.com the transformation went from small applications to complex micro services architectures. This change did also impact the infrastructure not only by numbers of servers, also on complexity of the system and ended with hybrid model of cloud and bare metal solution. In this talk I will cover how our team of DevOps and Engineers battles with tasks such as deployment to many enviroments, infrastructure changes, monitoring and also creation of processes and runbooks. We believe that this talk can inspire you to adapt changes within your teams and never stop improving how you manage your infrastructure.",
