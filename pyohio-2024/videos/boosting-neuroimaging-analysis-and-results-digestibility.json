    "description": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) measures brain activity, and despite\nadvancements in sensors since its 1924 invention, its result\npresentation has changed very little. We're addressing this using MNE,\nan open-source Python library.\n\nJoin us to simplify neuroimaging results for patients and enhance\nvisualization tools for technicians. Affordable biotracking devices now\ncapture brain wave data, and MNE enables innovative data export and\nmanipulation. This opens new possibilities for advanced statistics,\nimproved visualizations, and enhanced analysis capabilities.\n\nNo medical background is required \u2013 join us in revolutionizing brain\nactivity interpretation, making it more accessible and meaningful for\neveryone.\n",
