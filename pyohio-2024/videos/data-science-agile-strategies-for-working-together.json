    "description": "Data science and Agile aren't famous for getting along. Data scientists\ncomplain that Agile frameworks are too restrictive and deadline-focused\nto accommodate the type of work they do. Scrum masters and product\nowners have a hard timing planning around unclear timelines and\nuncertain outcomes, and wish the data scientists would just tell them\nhow much effort a task will take.\n\nBut it doesn't have to be this way! Data science and Agile can work\ntogether to create a better system for everyone. In this talk I'll\nhighlight tips and pitfalls from my own experience, as well as stories\nI've heard from my colleagues.\n",
