    "description": "Generators and Iterators are two core features of Python that are often\nmisunderstood and overlooked. And yet they are extremely powerful and\nexpressive parts of the language. They can be especially useful in data\nprocessing, systems integration, or in projects with limited resources.\nIn this talk, we'll get into the fundamentals of what iterators and\ngenerators actually are, how they're different from one another, and how\nthey work under the hood. We will explore how to create your own custom\niterators and generators for use in your own projects. Throughout the\ndiscussion, we'll make comparisons to the simple children's game \"Snakes\n& Ladders,\" and by the end of the talk we should have a simple working\nexample of the game built with iterators and generators.\n\nNOTE: Slides and sample code for this talk can be found at\nhttps://github.com/jrrickerson/snakes_and_ladders\n",
