    "description": "Have you seen ``pathlib``? If not, once I show you, you will never go\nback to string paths and ``os.path`` ever again! ``pathlib`` turns paths\ninto path objects, which have attributes and methods that cover a number\nof operations. In this talk, we will:\n\n-  Talk about how to create ``Path`` objects, and how this differs on\n   Windows vs Mac/Linux\n-  Talk about the many properties of pure paths\n-  Talk about folder operations from ``Path`` objects, such as creating\n   directory structures and recursive globbing.\n-  Talk about file operations, made simpler with ``Path`` objects, such\n   as reading contents, getting properties like file size, and deleting.\n\nStop messing with string paths and get with ``pathlib``!\n",
