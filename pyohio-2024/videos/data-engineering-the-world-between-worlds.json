    "description": "Data engineering is an often misunderstood, conflated range of skills\nfrom database administration, analytics, ETL, cloud infrastructure, big\ndata and back. As someone who worked as a data engineer for just over 5\nyears, I\u2019d love to share my stories about my time as a data engineer to\npull back the curtain on what kind of value you might be able to get\nfrom data engineering as the heat of ML Ops and AI takes flight, both as\norganization and individual. Notably, many data engineering teams\nheavily leverage Python due to the depth and breadth of the data\nlibraries, and the ease by which folks can learn Python to start\ncreating value within the space. We'll also talk about a few of the key\nlibraries that you can learn to set yourself apart if you decide data\nengineering is for you!\n",
