    "description": "Vector-Symbolic Architectures (a.k.a. Hyperdimensional Computing) is a\nrelatively new computational paradigm that involves the use of random\nvectors in a high-dimensional space to represent and process\ninformation. As a computational paradigm, it finds applications in a\nwide range of fields, including artificial intelligence, natural\nlanguage processing, internet-of-things, robotics, bioinformatics, and\nother scientific domains.\n\nHere we are going to introduce some fundamental concepts at the base of\nHyperdimensional Computing, following a presentation of *hdlib*, a\nlibrary for building Vector-Symbolic Architectures with Python. Finally,\nwe are going to see how to easily build a machine learning model based\non the Hyperdimensional Computing paradigm as a practical use case.\n\nAs a reference, *hdlib* is open-source, it is available on GitHub at\n` <https://github.com/cumbof/hdlib>`__\\ https://github.com/cumbof/hdlib,\nand it is published on the Journal of Open Source Software at\n` <https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.05704>`__\\ https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.05704.\n",
