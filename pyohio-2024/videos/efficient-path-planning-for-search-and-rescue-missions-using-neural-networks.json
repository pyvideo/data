    "description": "Utilizing the Python programming language and the Tkinter library, I\npropose to develop a simulated robotic application tailored for search\nand rescue missions. Central to this endeavor is the integration of a\nneural network, trained on pertinent search and rescue data, to\neffectively guide the robotic agent towards areas with a high\nprobability of locating survivors. The neural network's computations\nyield a dynamic cost map, which takes into account both traversal costs\nand the priority of various regions within the search area. This cost\nmap serves as a comprehensive tool, continuously furnishing the robotic\nagent with insights into the search region and optimizing its search\nstrategy. Importantly, this approach is conceived to address challenges\ninherent in reinforcement learning, such as the lack of a global view\nand the need to balance multiple objectives in search and rescue\nmission.\n",
