    "description": "With the 20th anniversary of the Zen of Python coming up in August, now\nis the perfect time to reflect on how it has influenced the evolution of\nthe Python language and how we write software in Python over the last 2\ndecades. Has Python moved closer to the ideals expounded in the Zen, or\nhas it drifted further away? Like many great software engineering\nprinciples, different portions of the PEP are in contention with each\nother at times, which can be revealed in the features and patterns of\nthe language. What does the current relationship between the language\nand the PEP say about the Python community and ecosystem as a whole, as\nwell as perhaps the most important question: is the Zen of Python still\nrelevant today?\n",
