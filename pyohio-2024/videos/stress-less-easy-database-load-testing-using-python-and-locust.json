    "description": "Overview\n--------\n\nMany people have probably used Locust or a tool built on top of it (like\nLoad Forge) in the past. These tools are primarily used for web\napplication load testing by hitting public endpoints and monitoring how\nthey respond. In this talk we review how to use Locust to load test a\nPostgreSQL database.\n\nAdditional Info\n---------------\n\nThis is a link to an article I wrote about this topic:\nhttps://miguel-codes.medium.com/unconventional-load-testing-leveraging-python-locust-for-postgresql-stress-testing-d6e07d63714b\n",
