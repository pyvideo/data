    "description": "When someone finds Python slow, Cython is a popular choice to speed it\nup. But how slow is any given thing you\u2019re doing? How much faster is\nCython? 100X of what? In this talk, we will write some python data\nanalysis code in Cython, read some parts of its generated code to\nunderstand what all Python has to do to run it, and understand how long\ndifferent things take by running microbenchmarks. We will then see how\nsimple hints to Cython can help it generate faster code, and see how\nfast it gets. This talk is intended for Python users writing performance\nsensitive applications, who are at least mildly familiar with Cython\nand/or C/C++. Attendees will learn how to profile and optimize common\noperations, which should help them to evaluate Cython or Python for\ntheir use-case.\n",
