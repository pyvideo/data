    "description": "Over the last couple of years, CPython's compiler was refactored. In\nversion 3.13, we will have access from Python scripts to more of the\ncompilation stages: Instead of the old 4-stage pipeline (source -->\ntokens --> AST --> code object), we will have a more refined pipeline\n(source --> tokens --> AST --> optimized AST --> pseudo bytecode -->\noptimized pseudo bytecode --> bytecode --> code object).\n\nThis talk describes the new compilation pipeline of CPython 3.13 and the\npossibilities that it creates for CPython users, maintainers and\neducators. It presents Codoscope, a new vizualization tool that displays\nCPython's process of translating Python source code into an executable\ncode object.\n",
