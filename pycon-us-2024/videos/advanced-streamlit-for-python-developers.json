    "description": "This tutorial will be a deep dive into advanced Streamlit features and\nstrategies to build robust, performant web apps in Python. Participants\nare welcome to bring their own app ideas to implement during this\ntutorial, but they will also have the opportunity to follow along as we\nbuild an example app together. The example app is a multi-page dashboard\nfocused on your GitHub historical activity that also allows you to\nexplore this data through a chatbot.\n\nThe intended audience of this talk is Python developers with the desire\nto build robust web applications using only Python \u2013 no HTML, CSS, or\nJavaScript required. Some experience with Streamlit will be helpful but\nis not a prerequisite. Attendees will walk away with practical knowledge\nof advanced Streamlit usage including performance optimization through\ncaching, session state management, and app testing.\n",
