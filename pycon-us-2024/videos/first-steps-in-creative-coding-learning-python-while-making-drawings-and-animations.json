Recently we lost the pioneering 'Grande Dame' of\ncomputational art, `Vera\nMoln\u00e1r <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_Moln%C3%A1r>`__ at 99! In the\nlast 20 years a growing community of practitioners of \"creative coding\"\nhas emerged, many using Processing (Java based), p5js (JavaScript based)\nor other programming languages. I can assure you it might be one of the\nmost wonderfully fun ways of learning how to code. So let's see how we\ncan use Python to draw amazing images, static, moving or interactive,\nusing some of the latest and most promising Python creative coding\ntools.\n\n`An image of Vera Moln\u00e1r from\nwikipedia <https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Vera_Moln%C3%A1r_%281996%29.png/506px-Vera_Moln%C3%A1r_%281996%29.png>`__\n",
