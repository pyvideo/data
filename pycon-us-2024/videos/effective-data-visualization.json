    "description": "From picking the right plot for the particular type of data, statistic,\nor result; to pre-processing sophisticated datasets, and even making\nimportant decisions about the aesthetic of a figure, visualization is\nboth a science and art that requires both knowledge and practice to\nmaster.\n\nThis tutorial is for python users who are familiar with python and basic\nplotting, and want to build strong visualization skills that will let\nthem effectively communicate any data, statistic, or result.\n\nWe will use python libraries such as ``seaborn``, ``matplotlib``,\n``plotly``, and ``sklearn``; and discuss topics such as density\nestimation, dimensionality reduction, interactive plotting, and making\nsuitable choices for communication. Drawing examples from datasets in\nthe scientific, financial, geospatial (mapping), education fields, and\nmore.\n",
