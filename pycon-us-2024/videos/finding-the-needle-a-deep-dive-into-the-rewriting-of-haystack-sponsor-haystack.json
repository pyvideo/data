    "description": "Haystack is an open-source framework. With Haystack you can compose\nvarious NLP tools to build applications, with a particular focus on\nLarge Language Models. Haystack was built before the \u201cChatGPT\nrevolution\u201d. Same as many others in this industry, we had to question\nall the existing assumptions in order to adapt, and we had to do it\nfast.\n\nIn this talk, we'll explore the motivations behind the refactoring, the\nchallenges we faced, and the outcomes achieved through this intensive\nprocess. From rethinking many of the original abstractions, all the way\nup to growing a vibrant community of users and contributors, we\u2019ll share\nthe key strategies and techniques employed during this journey.\n\nWhether you're a seasoned open-source contributor or a curious\nenthusiast, this talk promises to uncover valuable insights and lessons\nlearned from the evolution of Haystack.\n",
