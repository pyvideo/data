We will demonstrate some apps you can start building today on\nCloudflare\u2019s full-featured developer platform, making use of robust\nbatteries-included integrations with Cloudflare database, object\nstorage, AI inference, and vector database solutions. Python Workers\nalso support a variety of packages such as Pandas, Pydantic, and\nFastapi.\n\nAfter the demos, we will discuss some technical challenges we overcame\nto make Pyodide, a Python runtime built for WebAssembly, work in the\nCloudflare Workers serverless runtime. Specifically, we will dive into\nmemory snapshots, FFI bindings, and stack switching.\n",
