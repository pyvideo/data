    "description": "The modern mobile phone is an incredibly powerful computing device.\nHowever, mobile platforms have historically excluded the Python data\nscience community, requiring specialist platform-specific skills, or\nmaking the use of Python data science tools exceedingly difficult.\n\nThis isn't true any more. In this talk, you'll learn how to build and\nrun an app on your phone that uses the Python data analysis and\nvisualization tools you're already familiar with, like NumPy and\nMatplotlib. No special mobile development skills are required; only a\nbasic familiarity with Python.\n",
