    "description": "The more complex your ML project becomes, the more challenging it is to\nmanage and deploy it into production. Beyond reproducibility, factors\nsuch as flexibility, readability, and production readiness play crucial\nroles in enhancing project efficiency. This is where Kedro comes in, a\nframework specifically designed to take your ML projects to another\nlevel.\n\nIn this talk, I will introduce Kedro and explain the contexts in which\nit should be used. You'll gain hands-on experience with Python, learning\nhow to smoothly integrate Kedro into your projects. This will enable you\nto spend less time on tedious 'plumbing' work and more time focusing on\nsolving new problems.\n",
