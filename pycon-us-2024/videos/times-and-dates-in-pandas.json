    "description": "Pandas is famously flexible and capable at analyzing numeric data. But\nPandas is also flexible and capable at working with times and dates. In\nthis talk, I'll describe the dtypes associated with times and dates, the\nsorts of calculations you can perform, issues with parsing and importing\ndatetime data, and how you can perform more complex tasks, such as\ngrouping, pivoting, and resampling. By the time this talk is over,\nyou'll be able to work with time-based data in new ways.\n\ntimes and dates work, from handling inputs to performing sophisticated\nanalysis.\n",
