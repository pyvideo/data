    "description": "The documentation for your Python package is already peppered with\nexamples \u2013 what if users could run them in an interactive REPL, right\ninside the online documentation? With PyScript, developers can add an\ninteractive Python session to any webpage, including integration with\nSphinx, MkDocs, readthedocs, and GitHub Pages. Your documentation\nexamples become an interactive learning session with zero backend or\ninstallation.\n\nIn this talk, you will learn how to enhance your Python web\ndocumentation by making it interactive and runnable anywhere, in a fully\nserverless way.\n",
