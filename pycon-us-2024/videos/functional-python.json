    "description": "Python supports multiple programming paradigms. In addition to the\nprocedural and object-oriented approach, it also provides some features\nthat are typical for functional programming.\n\nWhile these features are optional, they can be useful to create better\nPython programs. This tutorial introduces Python features that help to\nimplement parts of Python programs in the functional style. Objective is\nnot to write pure functional programs but improve programs design by\nusing functional feature where suitable.\n\nThe tutorial points out advantages and disadvantages of functional\nprogramming in general and in Python in particular. Participants will\nlearn alternative ways to solve problems. This will broaden their\nprogramming toolbox.\n",
