    "description": "An astonishing 96.3% of websites have accessibility issues. As a Python\ndeveloper, you can be a part of the effort to turn that number around.\n\nIn this workshop, we\u2019ll introduce you to the Web Content Accessibility\nGuidelines (WCAG) and show you practical ways to incorporate\naccessibility into your web development. We\u2019ll build a blog website\nusing a Python-powered content management system called\n`Wagtail <https://wagtail.org>`__ and demonstrate how you can make your\nproject more accessible as you go. We\u2019ll show you how to customize\nWagtail\u2019s accessibility tools to continuously test and improve your\nwebsite accessibility over time.\n\nTo benefit the most from this tutorial, students should have at least\nsome basic knowledge of Python and\n`Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`__. A laptop with Python 3.8 or\nabove installed on it is required to participate in the hands-on\nexercises.\n",
