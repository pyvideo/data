    "description": "ABSTRACT\n========\n\nIn this tutorial, you\u2019ll dive into the fundamentals of API security for\nPython applications. You\u2019ll learn best practices and patterns for API\nauthentication and authorization and for API security by design.\n\nWe\u2019ll go through the OWASP top 10 API vulnerabilities. We\u2019ll see\npractical examples of how they occur, including examples from real-world\nAPIs. We\u2019ll analyze the vulnerabilities, understand what the attack\nvectors are, and how we address them.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn how Open Authorization (OAuth) and OpenID Connect (OIDC)\nwork for APIs. You\u2019ll learn about the risks and advantages of using\nthese protocols, known vulnerabilities, and best practices to avoid\nthem. You\u2019ll also learn about JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and how to use them\ncorrectly for access authorization.\n\nFinally, you\u2019ll learn how to automate the process of detecting and\naddressing security vulnerabilities in your APIs using fuzzy testers\nlike schemathesis and design-testing tools like spectral.\n\nThroughout the tutorial, we\u2019ll use examples of OpenAPI specifications,\nand code examples in Flask and FastAPI. You\u2019ll make the best out of the\ntutorial if you have some experience working with APIs.\n\nIf you work with APIs (who doesn\u2019t!), I\u2019d love to welcome you to this\ntutorial to learn how to build and deliver secure APIs!\n",
