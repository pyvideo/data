    "description": "``pytest`` is Python's most popular test framework. It makes testing\nsimple and fun, and its rich plugin ecosystem enables you to do just\nabout anything! However, writing *good* tests is still challenging.\nThere is testing theory that goes along with testing practice.\n\nIn this tutorial, let's learn how to start testing in Python with\n``pytest``. Specifically, we will cover:\n\n#. Configuring projects for testing\n#. Writing and running test functions with pytest's basic mechanics\n#. Parameterizing tests\n#. Handling setup and cleanup with fixtures\n#. A little bit of mocking to go a long way\n#. Testing web APIs and UIs with Playwright\n\nBring your laptops, because we will be doing hands-on code the whole\ntutorial! By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to test your\nPython code like a champion.\n",
