    "description": "What's the best thing you can do with a piece of paper?\n\nI'm not talking about paper planes or dragons (or even Mr. Napkin Head).\nThe elegant art of paper folding can be harnessed to perform\nsurprisingly powerful calculations. From a handful of basic folding\naxioms, we will construct computational systems to solve a wide range of\nproblems. Starting with basic arithmetic operations, we will build up to\ntackling cubic equations and even proofs of irrationality.\n\nI'll be simulating the fold sequences in a custom Python library, but\nfeel free to bring a sheet of paper to follow along.\n",
