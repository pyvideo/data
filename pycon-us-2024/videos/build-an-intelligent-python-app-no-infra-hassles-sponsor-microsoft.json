In this session, explore how\nto take your Python app from **code to cloud** on a *serverless*\n*containers* platform \u2013 *Azure Container Apps*, with *no\ncontainerization knowledge needed*. Leverage its built-in resilient\nplatform capabilities to build APIs with popular frameworks like\n*FastAPI*. Fulfill your *ML* needs for frameworks like *PyTorch* with\nits *GPU* compute options. Easily integrate with *Azure OpenAI* to build\n**LLM-based applications** for scenarios like *RAG*, *chatbots* and\nmore, as well as mitigate any risks to your **security posture** with\n*Azure Container Apps*. Join us for an end-to-end development to\ndeployment experience on how to build an intelligent Python app.\n",
