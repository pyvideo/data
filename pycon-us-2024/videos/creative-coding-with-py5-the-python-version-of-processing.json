    "description": "`py5 <https://py5coding.org>`__ is a framework for doing creative coding\nin Python that is very similar to the widely used Java framework\n`Processing <https://processing.org/>`__.\n\nThe goal of this talk is to introduce py5 to the Python community and\ndemonstrate how it can be used for data visualization, art, and\neducation. It is accessible to beginners while also being capable of\nsupporting professional artists creating digital art that is shown in\ngalleries. By design, py5 is integrated into the Python ecosystem,\nworking well with popular Python libraries such as numpy, matplotlib,\nPIL, shapely, and trimesh.\n",
