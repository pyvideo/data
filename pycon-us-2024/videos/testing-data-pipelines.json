    "description": "Hello \ud83d\udc4b!\n\nI'll review few great ways to test data pipelines in this talk. This\napproach's primary goal is to ensure data flows smoothly through the\npipelines by quickly identifying and fixing any problems. While the talk\nuses Airflow as the base, the techniques presented are toolkit-agnostic.\n\nWhen it comes to testing pipelines, the process is similar to testing\nsoftware applications. It includes running unit tests for each pipeline\ncomponent, integration tests for the entire pipeline, and end-to-end\ntests to ensure accurate data output. However, I'll also discuss unique\nmethods like data snapshot testing and online and offline data quality\nchecks.\n",
