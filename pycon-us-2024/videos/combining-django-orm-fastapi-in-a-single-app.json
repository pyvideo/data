    "description": "Django is the most extensive Python framework, which is also very\nopinionated and synchronous. In contrast, FastAPI emerges as a more\nrecent, asynchronous framework.\n\nAs a developer and the maintainer of several services, one of which is a\ndata visualization tool deployed in production across various companies,\nI have had the unique opportunity to use Django ORM with FastAPI. If you\ntake a look through GitHub or other resources, you\u2019ll notice there\u2019s not\nmuch out there about combining Django and FastAPI \u2014 it\u2019s a bit of an\nunconventional setup. The aim of my talk is to share insights from my\nexperience with this setup, highlighting its practical implementation\nand the lessons learned along the way.\n\nThis talk is aimed at programmers from beginners to more experienced\nones familiar with either of these frameworks. You\u2019ll gain insights into\ncombining asynchronous frameworks with synchronous ones, along with\nunderstanding the benefits and challenges of this approach.\n",
