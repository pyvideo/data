    "description": "**Data Bias:** ensuring that the training data is not biased. Biased\ndata can lead to AI models that are unfair or discriminatory. For\nexample, if a dataset for facial recognition software predominantly\ncontains images of people from certain ethnic groups, the model may\nperform poorly on faces from underrepresented groups. **Insufficient\nData Variety:** AI models require diverse data to understand different\nscenarios and variations. If the training data is too homogeneous or\nlacks variety, the model might not perform well in real-world, diverse\nconditions. **Overfitting and Underfitting:** Overfitting occurs when a\nmodel is too complex and learns to fit the training data so closely that\nit fails to generalize to new data. Underfitting happens when the model\nis too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. **Poor\nData Quality:** If the training data is full of errors, inconsistencies,\nor is poorly labeled, the AI model will likely inherit these flaws.\nEnsuring high data quality is essential for developing reliable and\naccurate AI models. **Ignoring Data Drift:** Over time, the real-world\ndata that an AI model encounters may change or 'drift' from the data on\nwhich it was trained. This can happen due to evolving trends, behaviors,\nor environments. Failing to monitor and adapt to these changes can\nrender an AI model less effective or even obsolete.\n",
