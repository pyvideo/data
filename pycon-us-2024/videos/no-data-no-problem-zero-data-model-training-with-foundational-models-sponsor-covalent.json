    "description": "In this talk, we introduce a streamlined method for training smaller,\ntask-specific models without the need for new data by utilizing\nfoundational models. We'll cover the process of leveraging existing\nopen-source foundational large models to impart knowledge to more\ncompact models tailored for specific tasks. The focus will be on how\ndevelopers can apply these techniques using open-source tools to enhance\ntheir projects.\n",
