    "description": "All modern systems use **distributed** and **asynchronous** tasks to\nmake proper use of the available hardware and software resources in a\nsafe and reliable manner. The ability to create and distribute\nasynchronous tasks drastically impact the performance as well as the\ncapability of a system.\n\nThe most popular way of creating asynchronous task queues involves using\nstreams or pub/sub infrastructures like **Apache Kafka**, **RabbitMQ**,\n**Kinesis** etc, more or less, are equally suitable for a variety of\nscenarios.\n\nThen, the question is why we\u2019re talking something else i.e. **\u201cCelery\u201d**\nover here? The answer is **\u201cPython Programming Language\u201d**.\n\nIf you're creating a system (especially microservices based and/or\ndistributed systems) in **python\\_\\_ and want to create an asynchronous\n(and distributed) task queues which is pure python, simple, super fast,\nand diminishes the boundary between distributed systems\\_, then you\nshould consider using** \u201cCelery\u201d\\_\\_\\_.\n\nUsing something like **\u201cCelery\u201d** is not about being better than other\nsolutions out there, it\u2019s all about the ability to make use of the\npython ecosystem and create things faster without leaving the python\nprogramming language for something else.\n\nWelcome to this tutorial on Celery, the open source distributed task\nqueues. In this tutorial, we'll learn how to use **\u201cCelery\u201d** and create\nan end to end system. We\u2019ll also learn about how we can also visualize\nthe distributed task queues at runtime using **\u201cFlower\u201d**\n\nThis tutorial will have classroom exercises, post class homeworks as\nwell as complimentary readings. All the presentation, code, exercises\nwill be shared in advance (~ 2 - 3 days) and the solutions of the\nexercise will be shared after the tutorial is completed.\n",
