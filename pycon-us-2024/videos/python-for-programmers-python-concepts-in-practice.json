    "description": "If you've moved to Python from another programming language, it's easy\nto overlook features that Python has which the other languages you know\ndon't. It's also easy to overlook the fundamental concepts that Python\nlibrary authors tend to embrace.\n\nUsing Vim (an old text editor) becomes quite a bit easier once one\nrealizes the way Vim sees the world. Likewise, **using Python becomes\nmuch easier once you understand the way Python sees the world**.\n\nDuring this workshop we'll explore:\n\n-  Mutability and variable assignment in Python\n-  How objects, operators, and methods actually work\n-  Lambda functions, decorators functions, and what makes these concepts\n   special\n-  What it means for something to be an \"iterable\"\n",
