    "description": "**Software Documentation** is one of the most crucial component of an\nopen source software, as it determines either the adoption or the\nfailure of the project. For this reason, a big effort is currently\ndevoted in the community to `support <https://www.python.org/doc/>`__\nand\n`sustain <https://devguide.python.org/documentation/help-documenting/index.html>`__\nan entire ecosystem of documentation\n`tools <https://wiki.python.org/moin/DocumentationTools>`__ and\nframeworks (e.g. ```diataxis`` <https://diataxis.fr/>`__).\n\nGood examples of great software docs certainly include\n`Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`__ framework, or\n`Scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/>`__, whose\n`examples <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/index.html>`__\nare made available for interactive execution in Jupyter-like\nenvironments.\n\nNevertheless, recent advances to `Python on\nWASM <https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/#tier-3>`__ enables unprecedented\nscenarios for interactivity, giving users the ability to run code\ndirectly in the browser, with no setup required, and without leaving the\ndocumentation at all!\n\nThis is the angle I would like to explore with this talk, with\nparticular emphasis on the `PyScript <https://pyscript.net>`__ platform.\nIn fact PyScript integrates multiple\n`interpreters <https://pyscript.github.io/docs/2023.12.1/user-guide/architecture/#interpreters>`__;\nit features a new Pythonic\n`API <(https://pyscript.github.io/docs/2023.12.1/user-guide/dom/)>`__\nfor the DOM; supports non-blocking execution threads using\n`WebWorkers <https://pyscript.github.io/docs/2023.12.1/user-guide/workers/>`__;\nand ships core-plugins providing `Python\nTerminals <https://pyscript.github.io/docs/2023.12.1/user-guide/terminal/>`__,\nand notebook-like `code\neditors <https://pyscript.github.io/docs/2023.12.1/user-guide/terminal/>`__\nrunning directly in the browser. All those features fit perfectly in the\ncontext of interactive documentation, and will be demonstrated in action\nin this talk as proof-of-principle.\n",
