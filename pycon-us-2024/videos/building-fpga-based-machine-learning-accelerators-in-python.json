    "description": "In this talk, we will demo a simple machine learning accelerator\ndeployed on a commodity FPGA and developed using a Python-based\ntoolchain. The FPGA platform is based on an entry level Xilinx FPGA,\nwith a total cost of materials <$200. The toolchain uses a combination\nof open source software, including PyTorch and\n`ONNX <https://onnx.ai/>`__ for modeling, and\n`Migen <https://github.com/m-labs/migen>`__ and\n`LiteX <https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex>`__ for the construction\nof the System-on-chip. We will also survey the wide array of both open\nsource and proprietary vendor tools necessary to build this project, and\ndiscuss the broader open source silicon landscape.\n",
