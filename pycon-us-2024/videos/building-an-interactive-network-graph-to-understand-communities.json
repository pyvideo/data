    "description": "Abstract\n--------\n\nPeople are hard to understand, developers doubly so! In this tutorial,\nwe will explore **how communities form** in organizations to develop a\nbetter solution than *\"The Org Chart\"*. We will walk through using a few\nkey Python libraries in the space, develop a toolkit for Clustering\nAttributed Graphs (more on that later) and build out an extensible\ninteractive dashboard application that promises to take your legacy HR\nreporting structure to the **next level**.\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nIn this tutorial, we will develop some fundamental knowledge on Graph\nTheory and capabilities in using key Python libraries to construct and\nanalyze network graphs, including ``xarray``, ``networkx``, and\n``dash-cytoscape``. We will also dig into exploratory data analysis of\npeople data, and use ``faker`` to generate realistic *people* data that\nmatches our statistical understanding, without breaching data privacy.\nThe goal of this talk is to build the tools you need to launch your own\ninteractive dashboard in Python that can help explore communities of\npeople based on shared characteristics (e.g. programming languages,\nprojects worked on, apps used, management structure). The data we will\ndig into focuses on building a better understanding of **developers +\nusers** and *how* they form communities, but this could just as easily\nbe extended to any social network. The work we do here can be easily\nextended to your communities and use cases -- let's build something\ntogether!\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\nBefore the tutorial, head over to\nhttps://lucasdurand.xyz/network-graph-tutorial/ for more information on\nsetting up your environment. If you have your own *people data*, bring\nthat along too and we can give it a try, but if not then we will make\nsome synthetic data as a stand-in.\n",
