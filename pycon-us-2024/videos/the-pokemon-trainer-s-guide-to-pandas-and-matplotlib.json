    "description": "Pandas and matplotlib are two staples of the Python ecosystem and\nfundamental if you're delving into the world of data science.\n\nIn this tutorial, we'll dispense with the typical and uninteresting data\nsets or highly theoretical introductions, and instead we'll use data\nfrom the `Pok\u00e9mon franchise <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok\u00e9mon>`__\nto provide a fun, hands-on introduction to the basics of data science\nwith pandas and matplotlib.\n\nYou don't need to be a Pok\u00e9mon enthusiast or connoisseur to join! All\nyou need to know is that this won't be your typical pandas tutorial.\n",
