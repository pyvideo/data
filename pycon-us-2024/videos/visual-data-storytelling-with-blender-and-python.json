    "description": "You might have encountered beautiful animations and data storytelling\nthrough many educators and experimentalists online and wondered if it\u2019s\nonly done in javascript or could also be done by Python. In this talk,\nthe attendees will learn how to blend the 3D animation power of Blender\nwith the 2D plotting capabilities from Python libraries like matplotlib,\nplotly, seaborn, etc.\n\nWe will demonstrate some practical techniques to create immersive 3D\nmodels with Blender and enhance them with detailed 2D plots, providing a\ncomprehensive narrative for data interpretation. By integrating these\ndata-viz tools, devs and data enthusiasts will discover new & impactful\nways to leverage Python to present and communicate their data insights\nfrom educational and work projects.\n",
