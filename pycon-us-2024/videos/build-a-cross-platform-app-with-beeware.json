    "description": "All code needs a user interface. That might be an API, or a web page -\nbut these days, many users will expect an app that they can install on\ntheir laptop, or on their phone. But how do you build a native\napplication in Python? And do you need to build a different version of\nyour app the app for every device and operating system you want to\nsupport?\n\nIn this hands-on tutorial, you'll lean how you can use the BeeWare suite\nof tools to build a graphical user interface for your code, and deploy\nthat code as a desktop app, and as a mobile app - all from a single\nPython codebase. You'll learn how to integrate third-party libraries\nlike NumPy into your app, and how to customize the appearance of your\npackaged app. You'll also learn how you can access device hardware (such\nas cameras and geolocation) in your app's code.\n\nNo experience with mobile or desktop app development is required; a\nbasic familiarity with Python is all you need. By the end of the\ntutorial, you'll have an app running on multiple platforms, written\nentirely by you, using nothing but Python.\n",
