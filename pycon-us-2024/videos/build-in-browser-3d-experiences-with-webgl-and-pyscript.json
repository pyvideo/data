    "description": "Did you know you can write Python to write no-nonsense 3D games and\ninteractive experiences that run entirely in the Web browser?\n\nPython's original killer app used to be ZOPE, an environment to create\ndynamic websites before \"content management system\" was even a term.\nNow, in 2024, the rules have changed. Web apps are predominantly\nclient-side, and JavaScript rules that use case. It doesn't have to be\nlike this!\n\nYou've probably heard about PyScript and maybe seen an intro or two.\nThis talk is something else. I will show you a deep dive into a single\ntopic: how to use PyScript with WebGL to harness the graphical power of\nthe Web browser. By the end of the talk, I expect you to gain confidence\nthat you can do it, too, and be inspired to try! The talk assumes\nfamiliarity with Python and high-school math.\n",
