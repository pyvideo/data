    "description": "Numerical simulation can be complicated and scary. Often, it is the\nexclusive realm of engineers and the highly trained, but it doesn't have\nto be that way! Simulation has a lot to offer to anyone interested in\ninvestigating the world around them and while the basics may seem\noverwhelming at first, it really can be valuable, and even fun to have a\nworking knowledge of the steps involved. This presentation is designed\nto prepare you with a basic grounding in simulation and how it works so\nthat you too can go away and build your own simulations, or more\nrealistically, use simulation tools (such as Ansys) to model every day\nthings. In particular this presentation will take you through an example\nscript of PyMAPDL (our Open Source Python interface for Ansys' original\nproduct: Mechanical APDL), modelling a simple 2D bridge\u00a0scenario.\n",
