    "description": "What makes a good API for a library? Or more importantly, what makes an\nAPI bad?\n\nImplementing an API is an art. It\u2019s the connection between the user and\nthe library itself. How can we optimize that connection to make the\nexperience more pleasing? What makes a user reach for one library over\nanother? What goes into an ergonomic API?\n\nThis talk will discuss what makes an API good: simplicity, consistency,\nand flexibility. We will apply those principles by iterating and\nimproving on a real world example, ending with a library that is\ndelightful to work with.\n",
