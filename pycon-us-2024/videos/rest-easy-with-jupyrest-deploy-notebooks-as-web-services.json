    "description": "Jupyter notebooks are awesome! However, a notebook on its own is not a\nproduct or a service. Bridging this gap usually involves a complete\nrewrite into a web service that leaves behind all the awesome-ness of\nthe notebook. What if we didn't have to do this? That's where Jupyrest\ncomes in! Jupyrest is a library I created to solve this exact problem\nfor my team at Microsoft. In this talk I'll show you how you can turn\nyour Jupyter notebooks into a web service without any modifications to\nit. Jupyrest is being used at Microsoft by data scientists to deploy\nhundreds of microservices.\n",
