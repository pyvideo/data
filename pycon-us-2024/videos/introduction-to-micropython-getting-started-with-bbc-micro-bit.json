    "description": "Did you know that you can use Python to program microcontrollers?\n\nMicroPython is an re-implementation of Python targeted to\nmicrocontrollers. It's optimized to run on devices that have constrained\nmemory and CPU power . It makes it easier to interact with hardware,\ncompared with low level languages such as C and C++.\n\nIn this tutorial you'll learn how to use the resources of the BBC\nmicro:bit, an open source embedded device that lets you control\nelectronic components using MicroPython. Some of the components you'll\nlearn to use in this tutorial include: \\* Push buttons \\* 5x5 LED matrix\n\\* Accelerometer sensor \\* Radio communication.\n\nThe goal of the tutorial is to implement a version of the Battleship\ngame that can be controlled using the accelerometer sensor.\n\nThis tutorial is designed for attendees with a basic understanding of\nPython. No prior knowledge of electronics is required. The tutorial will\ncover all necessary concepts from the ground up, making it suitable for\nthose who are new to the world of electronics.\n",
