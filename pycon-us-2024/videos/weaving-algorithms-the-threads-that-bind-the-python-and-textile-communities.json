    "description": "There are a lot of curious crossovers between programming and fiber\narts, from the origins of punch cards to borrowed terminology and shared\ncultural mores. Computing drew a surprising amount from fiber arts, and\nas I began programming and knitting around the same time I was\nfascinated to consider things such as how knitting patterns can be\nviewed with the same conceptual framework as programs, and that\nunderstanding how to modify one can provide interesting insights to the\nother. Both the Python and textile communities are also wonderfully\ndiverse and put some very important efforts in place to encourage\ninclusivity, which has helped lead me to feel comfortable sharing these\ninsights with such a large audience. This talk aims to get people\nthinking a bit outside the box and understanding connections with\ncommunities they might not have interacted with before.\n",
