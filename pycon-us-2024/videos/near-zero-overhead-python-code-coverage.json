    "description": "Code *coverage* shows what lines or branches your tests are missing. If\nyou maintain Python code, chances are you use ``coverage.py`` to measure\nit. You probably don't use it all the time, though, as it slows down\nyour tests -- up to a whopping 2.6x. This talk introduces SlipCover, a\nnew tool that brings this overhead down to only 5%. We look into what\nslows down ``coverage.py``, and show how ``SlipCover`` is able to do\nbetter. For Python 3.12, SlipCover adopts the new `Low Impact Monitoring\nAPI <https://peps.python.org/pep-0669/>`__ (PEP669); we discuss the\nadvantages and challenges of integrating it into SlipCover.\n",
