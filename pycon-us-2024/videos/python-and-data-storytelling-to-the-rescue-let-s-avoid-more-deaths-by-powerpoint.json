    "description": "**Abstract:** Over the past few years, I have experimented with various\npresentation formats (jupyter notebook + RISE, streamlit, and quarto)\nand graphic libraries (matplotlib, seaborn, altair, powerbi, tableau,\nvizzu) in search of greater interactivity when presenting and teaching.\nAt the same time, I became very interested in the related topic of data\nstorytelling, which focuses on the skills and hacks to make a\npresentation memorable and impactful. I think this combination of\nconcepts (Python and Data Storytelling) is innovative and has not been\nsufficiently explored and taught. During the talk, I will share insights\nand suggestions on different skills and technical tools that we can use\nto create more engaging, entertaining, and memorable presentations using\nPython libraries and programs. Let's make the world better, one\npresentation at a time!\n",
