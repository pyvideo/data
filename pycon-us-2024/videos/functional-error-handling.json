    "description": "In the early days, people wrote small applications in assembly language,\nusing gotos to get around. This didn't scale, so we traded gotos for\nstructured functions with single entry and exit points\u2014and then we added\na new kind of goto with the exception, which not only blows up your\nfunction but can end up anywhere. This makes functions difficult to\ncompose. We\u2019ll look at strategies in Python that bring exceptions under\ncontrol and make functions composable again, including the third-party\n``returns`` library.\n",
