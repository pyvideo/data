While\nthe advent of APIs has made using external services so much more\naccessible, APIs can lead to flaky or deceptive tests, ultimately\nputting applications at risk. In this talk, you will learn how to use\nPython\u2019s Mock object to create more reliable stand-ins for APIs beyond\nyour control \u2026 all within the unittest framework.\n",
