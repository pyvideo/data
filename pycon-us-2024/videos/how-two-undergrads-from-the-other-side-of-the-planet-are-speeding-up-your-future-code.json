    "description": "CPython 3.13 is planned to get cool new performance features. One of\nthem is an experimental runtime bytecode optimizer, which will optimize\nbytecode on the fly using compiler optimizations. It aims to do\nfancy-sounding things like type propagation, guard elimination, constant\npromotion and more!\n\nWhat\u2019s less known - this optimizer is currently being built by a\nuniversity undergraduate \ud83d\ude32, with earlier iterations contributed by\nanother undergrad. We\u2019re also receiving course credit for it! One of us\nhad no prior experience contributing to CPython.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll split our time 60-40, with some time for the\nperformance enthusiasts out there, and the remaining time on our\nexperience contributing to CPython as an (in our opinion)\nunderrepresented group, and how you can contribute to CPython as a\nuniversity student as well.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a compiler or CPython expert to attend \u2013 this talk\nis aimed at everyone who can read and write some Python.\n",
