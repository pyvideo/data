    "description": "Is your relationship with maths... complicated?\n\nDo you hate doing simple, repetitive, error prone calculations that you\nknow your computer could trivially do?\n\nHave you ever been disappointed by Wolfram Alpha's inability to\ncalculate your problems with working out?\n\nThen book this session, and I'll show you the basics of SymPy, and cover\nsome university level math solutions by demonstrating a calculator to\nsolve and print working out for them.\n\nI\u2019ll also present how Jupyter can be used to display and submit parts of\nyour assignment, and finally how you can help contribute to the\ncomputational maths community.\n",
