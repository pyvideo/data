    "description": "The input devices of decades past hold nostalgic value for many folks.\nBut they don't need to merely sit on a shelf as museum objects\u2014they can\nbe reverse engineered and then adapted to modern computers without\nmodifying the original hardware.\n\nCircuitPython, an implementation of the Python language for\nmicrocontrollers, is an excellent language for projects like these,\nthanks to native USB Human Interface Device (HID) support and the\nability to \u2018bitbang\u2019 archaic interfaces combined with the fast\ndevelopment cycle of an interpreted language, as you'll learn in case\nstudies adapting these keyboards & mice.\n\nNo previous experience with CircuitPython is necessary. Some knowledge\nof electronics will enhance your enjoyment of this talk, though there\nwill be a quick summary of key electronics concepts as the talk\nproceeds.\n",
