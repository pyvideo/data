    "description": "For most people that use Python, worrying about memory is not an issue.\nBut that's not the case when you have to handle a lot of requests on a\nlarge scale. So how do you reduce memory consumption without affecting\nthe CPU?\n\nIn this presentation I'll discuss about memory management in Python from\nthe basics, where the necessity for PEP 683 came from, and the changes\nintroduced by it. I also intend to discuss why this PEP is so important\nfor the language, and what we'll be able to achieve with it in the\nfuture, such as changes to the GIL and true parallelism.\n\nThe talk is targeted for folks who are intermediate/advanced\npythonistas. People who are just starting with Python (maybe less than\n1.5 years) may feel a bit lost. Even so, curious learners are more than\nwelcome to join, and I'll try my best to make it easy for all audiences\non this advanced topic. After this presentation, participants will learn\na bit more about how memory management works under the hood in python,\nand how it may change in the next couple of years.\n",
