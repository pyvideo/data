    "description": "Bring your existing Python skills, existing testing framework, and\nfavorite IDE to start building on the blockchain! It has never been\neasier for you as a Python dev to add another powerful tool to your\ntoolbox. Why build on blockchain? It offers permanent, transparent\nrecord-keeping, enables traceability and provenance, and unlocks\nopportunities for innovation across industries.\n\nAll you need is your laptop, a willingness to code, and the same Python\ntoolchain you're already familiar with. We have everything you need to\ncode, including Poetry, Pytest, and Docker, wrapped up in a neat\npackage. To get you started quickly, some basic templates are included\ntoo! The best part? You can code using the free and open-source GitHub\nCodespaces virtual IDE, so no need to install anything locally. Within\nthe hour you'll deploy fundamental blockchain primitives, including data\nstorage CRUD, getter/setter methods, logic evaluations, and role-based\naccess control.\n\nBe the first in your team to know blockchain.\n",
