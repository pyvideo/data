From each of the major cloud providers\nand across functions to big data, the common denominator is Python. This\nmeans that a growing segment of Python developers are serverless\ndevelopers as well. In this session, we\u2019ll explore the community\nlibraries that exist to improve application observability. We will walk\nthrough\n\n-  Using Python to build an example service\n-  Leveling up the observability through\n-  Logging\n-  Metrics\n-  Telemetry\n-  Observability using cloud-native services\n-  Observability using Open Telemetry (OTEL)\n-  Step-by-Step Instrumentation of code\n\nAs an attendee of this session, you\u2019ll walk away with an understanding\nof how to approach making your serverless development observable by\ndesign and what some of the basic tools available to you look like as\nthey function and you scale your services.\n",
