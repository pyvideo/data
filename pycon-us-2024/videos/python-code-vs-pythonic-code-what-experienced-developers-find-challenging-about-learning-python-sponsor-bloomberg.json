    "description": "Python has a reputation for being very easy to learn. Despite this,\nexperienced developers often struggle with working as effectively with\nPython (e.g., writing Pythonic code) as they are with other programming\nlanguages with which they are more familiar. This talk will leverage the\nexperiences of a professional trainer to demystify this dichotomy with\nthe goal of understanding the motivating reasons for it, and making\nsuggestions on how to help developers new to Python move quickly from\nwriting Python code to writing Pythonic code.\n",
