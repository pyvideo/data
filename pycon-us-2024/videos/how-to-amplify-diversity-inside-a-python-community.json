    "description": "I once heard the question of whether there was a real need to create\nmore support subgroups for minorities in Python: whether, at the end of\nthe day, the community would be more segregated than united. When I\npassed this on to a few people, a new demand emerged: that there were\ndifficulties in creating more diverse teams.\n\nBased on the organization of meetups, regional events and ethnographic\nresearch among different tech communities, this talk seeks not only to\npresent possible solutions for increasing diversity in python\nenvironments (such as academia, companies and communities), but also to\ninstigate debate about where we can improve and how to truly listen to\npythonistas.\n\nThis talk also aims to explore already established tools - such as the\nCode of Conduct - and evolve them in the light of new minorities and to\nprovide a safe space for learning and connections.\n",
