If your numpy/panda-fu isn\u2019t all that great than it\u2019s a lot harder to do in Python. In R, for instance, you can declare a model with a formula as simple as y ~ x1 + x2. But in Python, you have to split out your target and input variables and make sure that the matrices work within the scikit-learn API.\n\nIn this talk I will introduce the Patsy package for describing and creating statistical models in Python. I\u2019ll walk through how to implement a logistic regression with Patsy and scikit-learn and I\u2019ll emphasize Patsy as a bridge for those who want to better understand Python and/or R.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
