Did you know that the web interface works like a modal editor such as VIM? Do you know that you can actually profile AND debug code in notebooks? How about setting formulas or use pre-made style settings for visualizations? Let us go through the tricks of the trade together!\n\nAbstract\nOverview of the Jupyter project + setup to get everyone on board.\nHandling the UI, know the shortcuts\nDifferent type of cells\nExporting notebooks for presentations\nHandling different kernels\nSet styles for visualizations for professional quality\nMod the style of the web interface yourself via CSS\nProfiling code in notebooks, use Cython\nDebugging in notebooks\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other.
