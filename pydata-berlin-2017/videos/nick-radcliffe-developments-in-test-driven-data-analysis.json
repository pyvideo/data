This talk will extend the foundation parts of TDDA with extensions including tight constraints on string fields with automatically discovered regular expressions and automatically discovered relationships between datasets.\n\nAbstract\nTest-driven data analysis fuses and builds upon the ideas of test-driven development and reproducible research to support higher quality data analysis.\n\nFoundational concepts are: * Level 0: Reference Tests * Level 1: Automatic constraint discovery and validation.\n\nThis talk will extend these to cover tight constraints on string fields with * automatically discovered regular expressions with rexpy * constraints between datasets and probably more.\n\nBackground material:\n\nPyCon UK Talk, Cardiff, Test-Driven Data Analysis https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIw_7aUuY50\nBlog: http://tdda.info, especially posts http://www.tdda.info/the-new-referencetest-class-for-tdda and http://www.tdda.info/constraint-discovery-and-verification-for-pandas-dataframes\nOverview: http://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/patimes/four-ways-data-science-goes-wrong-and-how-test-driven-data-analysis-can-help/ In terms of some of the new material that will be covered in this talk, see\nhttp://www.tdda.info/introducing-rexpy-automatic-discovery-of-regular-expressions\nhttp://rexpy.herokuapp.com\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
