  "description": "Jack McCloy\nhttps://2016.pygotham.org/talks/252/advanced-permissioning\nIn many Django applications, permissioning (building rules for who has access to what) is pretty easy. Logged out users can see some stuff, logged in users can see more stuff, and superusers can see (and edit, and delete) all of the stuff! But when you want to handle more complex permissioning (like object-level permissions), it can get pretty ugly. This talk will help to de-uglify things for you.",
