  "description": "Jeff Revesz\nhttps://2016.pygotham.org/talks/331/restful-service-design-patterns-and-anti-patterns\nDrawing on more than a decade of combined experience in RESTful service design, your speakers will discuss many of the key architectural questions that every API developer needs to answer. The goal of this talk is to move quickly beyond the basics, and explore larger questions of how to build a sane and scalable service that your users will love. We will draw on our own experience of implementing bad (and later, less-bad) answers to these questions in multiple real-world situations, with specific examples demonstrated using Django REST Framework.",
