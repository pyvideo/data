  "description": "Everyone despises falling sick. In this talk, I will present how I used Python and machine learning to predict future sequences of the flu. My Random Forests model learns patterns in how the flu mutates from previous flu seasons, and creates decision trees based on those inferences. I will also cover how using a library (scikit-learn) was much easier and accurate than creating a Random Forests Classifier.",
