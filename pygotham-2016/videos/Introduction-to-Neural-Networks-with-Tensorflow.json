  "description": "Neural networks are a powerful machine learning model that are used in many applications, from computer vision and speech recognition to time series modeling and natural language processing. TensorFlow is an open source machine learning library developed by Google that can be used to easily create these types of models. I will give an overview of neural networks, and show how to implement and use these models using TensorFlow's Python API.",
