  "description": "Your Python program is too slow, and you need to optimize it. Where do you start? Optimization is a scientific investigation, just like debugging is: you generate hypotheses about how to make your program faster, then use benchmarks as the experiments that test your hypotheses. With the right tools, you can optimize your code where it counts. With the Python profiler \u201cYappi\u201d to understand its features and limitations we\u2019ll learn how to find the maximum performance wins with minimum effort.",
