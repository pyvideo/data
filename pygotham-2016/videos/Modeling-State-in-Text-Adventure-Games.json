  "description": "Although text adventure games, like Colossal Cave Adventure or Zork, don't have graphics, they still have in-game objects to model. I've been working on a framework for writing text adventure games in Python, which means setting on a system for modeling stateful things. In this talk, I'll discuss choosing a design pattern, modifying the pattern to work better in Python, and then use it to make a mini text adventure game!",
