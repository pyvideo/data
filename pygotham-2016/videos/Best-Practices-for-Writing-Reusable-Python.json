The \"what\" is easy, but the nuts and bolts are elusive. This talk discusses various ways of accomplishing this with multiple tested pathways. Who should come to this talk? Data Scientists, Web-Devs, Dev-Ops, if you've written code you want others to use, if you want to write code that others will use, this is for you. Who shouldn't come to this talk? If you already publish your own packages on PyPI and you get no joy out of critiquing people who give Best Practices talks, you might benefit more from one of the other talks.",
