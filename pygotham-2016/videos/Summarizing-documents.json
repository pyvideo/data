  "description": "Mike Williams\nhttps://2016.pygotham.org/talks/226/summarizing-documents\nExtractive summarization \u2014 finding the salient points in a document or corpus \u2014 is one of the most fundamental tasks in natural language processing. I\u2019ll show you three ways to do it. One dates back to an IBM Journal article from 1958. One uses topic modeling, a technology from the 2000s. And one uses neural network-derived language embeddings and long short term memory networks \u2014 techniques that are only a couple of years old. I\u2019ll explain the algorithms, show code and demos for all three, and I\u2019ll discuss the engineering trade-offs.",
