We can use this data to generate music that plays back to the user. One way to generate unique and interesting sounds is using Pyo, a python-based DSP library, in combination with custom MIDI samples. This talk will cover how we structure this data, turn the data into music, and stream it to the user using a python-based pipeline.",
