  "description": "Python is an extremely dynamic language with a very \"rich runtime.\" Unlike in a compiled language like C or go, symbols (functions and data objects) can be bound and rebound at runtime; swapped out without the need for complicated syntax and without the risk of unsafe complications.\nIn the Python community, this is called \"monkey-patching.\" But it's not as bananas as it sounds!\nIn fact, it can be a very useful mechanism for extending functionality or for making robust, surgical fixes to a code-base!",
