  "description": "Have you wanted to grab data from websites and automatically categorize it into a formatted list? Or maybe you want to opt out of registering for API keys and want data straight out of a web page? This is an introduction to web scraping and we will cover building bots through Scrapy to crawl a few sample web pages and have it extract information that we want. Prior knowledge not required; we\u2019ll break down the steps in creating your own bot, and before you know it you'll be scraping the web.",
