  "description": "Ahmed Abdalla\nhttps://2016.pygotham.org/talks/280/creating-a-bittorrent-client-using-asyncio\nThe purpose of this talk is explain the BitTorrent protocol and relevant Asyncio API used to create a BitTorrent client that can actually download a \".torrent\" file. The BitTorrent application will be built and presented as a set of steps (code snippets, i.e. coroutines) that implement various parts of the protocol and build up a final program that can download a file.\n\nAttendees need not know Asyncio and will learn the relevant functions needed to accomplish the task. No prior knowledge of the BitTorrent protocol is necessary either.",
