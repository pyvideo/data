  "description": "In this talk, we'll explore ten of the most paradoxical and mind-numbing \"Python wats\" -- unique edge cases in the language. We'll even go so far as to re-implement the stdlib functions which cause them to understand just why they actually make sense.\n\nThis is a fun and entertaining talk. In the end, attendees will gain insight into functions they use every day, including `zip`, `max`, `min`, `any`,  `all`,  and more. Even the simplest of tools, when combined, can produce really weird results!",
