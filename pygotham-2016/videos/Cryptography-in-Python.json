  "description": "Today we use cryptography in almost everywhere. From surfing the web over https, to working remotely over ssh. However, many of us do not appreciate the subtleties of crypto primitives, and the lack of correct and updated resources leads to design and development of vulnerable applications. In this talk, we cover the building block of modern crypto, and how to develop secure applications in Python.",
