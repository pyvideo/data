  "description": "Programme\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n-  The tutorial will begin with short introduction to the basic premise\n   of sparsity and highlight some problems in astronomical image\n   processing that can be solved using this methodology. (~15-20min;\n   slides)\n-  Tutees will then follow a hands-on demonstration of how the concept\n   of sparsity can be used to denoise signals. (~30-35min; interactive\n   jupyter notebook with exercises)\n-  Finally the tutees will learn how to denoise an astronomical image\n   and use their newfound skills to recover a nice picture of Saturn.\n   (~35-40min; interactive jupyter notebook with an exercise)\n\nRequirements\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n-  The tutorial contents are available on\n   `GitHub <https://github.com/sfarrens/euroscipy>`__.\n-  Provided tutees have a stable internet connection, the entire\n   tutorial can be run online using\n   `Binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sfarrens/euroscipy/master>`__.\n-  However, to be safe, tutees should download and install the tutorial\n   materials beforehand.\n\nThis tutorial will introduce the concept of *sparsity* and demonstrate\nhow it can be used to remove noise from signals. These concepts will\nthen be expanded to demonstrate how noise can be removed from\nastronomical images in particular.\n",
