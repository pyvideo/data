  "description": "| Sharing the result of a Jupyter notebook is currently not an easy\n  path. With voila we are changing this. Voila is a small but important\n  ingredient in the Jupyter ecosystem. Voila can execute notebooks,\n  keeping the kernel connected but does not allow for arbitrary code\n  execution, making it safe to share your notebooks with others.\n| With new libraries built on top of Jupyter widgets/ipywidgets\n  (ipymaterialui and ipyvuetify) we allow beautiful modern React and Vue\n  components to enter the Jupyter notebook. Using voila we can integrate\n  the ipywidgets seamlessly into modern React and Vue pages, to build\n  modern dashboards directly from a Jupyter notebook.\n| I will give a live example on how to transform a Jupyter notebook into\n  a fully functional single page application with a modern (Material\n  Design) look.\n\nTurn your Jupyter notebook into a beautiful modern React or Vue based\ndashboard using voila and Jupyter widgets.\n",
