At\n  the heart of this\n| software lies a module for the evaluation of electron-repulsion\n  integrals (ERIs) using the ObaraSaika recurrence scheme, where a high\n  degree of efficiency is achieved by employing\n| architecture-independent vectorization via OpenMP SIMD pragmas in the\n  auto- generated C++\n| source code. The software is topology aware and with a\n  Python-controlled work and task flow,\n| the idle time is minimized using an MPI/OpenMP partitioning of\n  resources.\n| In the second software layer, we have implemented a highly accurate\n  SCF start guess based\n| on atomic densities and a first-level of iterations in a reduced\n  version of the user-defined basis\n| set, leading to a very smooth convergence in the subsequent standard\n  DIIS scheme. This layer\n| also includes vectorized and OpenMP/MPI parallelized modules for\n  efficient generation of DFT\n| grid points and weights as well as kernel integration.\n| In the third software layer, we present real and complex response\n  functions as to address\n| dispersive and absorptive molecular properties in spectroscopy. The\n  kernel module in this layer\n| is the iterative linear response equation solver that we have\n  formulated and implemented for a\n| combination of multiple optical frequencies and multiple perturbation\n  operators. With efficient\n| use of computer memory, we enable the simultaneous reference to, and\n  solving of, in the order\n| of 1,000 response equations for sizable biochemical systems without\n  spatial symmetry, and we\n| can thereby determine electronic response spectra in arbitrary\n  wavelength regions, including\n| UV/vis and X-Ray, without resolving the sometimes embedded excited\n  states in the spectrum.\n| E.g. the electronic CD spectrum (involving the Cartesian sets of\n  electric and magnetic\n| perturbations) over a range of some 10 eV is obtained at a\n  computational cost comparable to\n| that of determining the transition energy of the lowest excited state,\n  or optimizing the electronic\n| structure of the reference state.\n\n| A new and efficient Python/C++ modular library for real and complex\n  response functions at the\n| level of Kohn-Sham density functional theory\n",
