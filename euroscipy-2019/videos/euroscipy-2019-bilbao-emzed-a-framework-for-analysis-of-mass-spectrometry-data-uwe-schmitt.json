  "description": "Many of the existing mass spectrometry data analysis tools are desktop\napplications designed for specific applications without support for\ncustomization. In addition, many of the commercial solutions offer no or\nonly limited functionality for exporting results.\n\nIn addition, the existing programming libraries in this area are\nscattered across different languages, mostly R, Java and Python.\n\nAs a result, data analysis in this area often consists of manual\nimport/export steps from/to various tools and self-developed scripts\nthat prevent the reproducibility of results obtained or automated\nexecution on high-performance infrastructures.\n\nemzed tries to avoid these problems by integrating existing libraries\nand tools from Python, R (and in the near future also Java) into an\neasy-to-use API.\n\n| To support workflow development and increase confidence in end results\n| emzed also offers tools for interactive visualization of mass\n  spectrometry related data structures.\n\nThe presentation introduces basics and concepts of emzed, some lessons\nlearned and current development of the next version of emzed.\n\nThis talk is about emzed, a Python library to support biologists with\nlittle programming knowledge to implement ad-hoc analyses as well as\nworkflows for mass-spectrometry data.\n",
