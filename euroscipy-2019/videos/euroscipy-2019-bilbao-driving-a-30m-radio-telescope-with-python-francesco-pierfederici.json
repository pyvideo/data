  "description": "The IRAM 30m radio telescope is one of the best in the world. It has\nbeen in operation non-stop since the mid 80s and is used to observe\n24-hours a day, 365 days a year. All of the high-level telescope control\nsoftware, monitoring, data archiving as well as some of the data\nprocessing software is written in Python. This choice, controversial at\nfirst, proved to be extremely successful making the IRAM 30m telescope\nextremely efficient.\n\nThis talk will describe how Python is used at the telescope, the reasons\nbehind these choices, lessons learned and future developments.\n\nThe IRAM 30m radio telescope is one of the best in the world. The\ntelescope control software, monitoring, data archiving as well as some\nof the data processing code is written in Python. We will describe how\nand why Python is used at the telescope.\n",
