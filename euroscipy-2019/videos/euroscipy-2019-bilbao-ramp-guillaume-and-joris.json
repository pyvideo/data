  "description": "We will give an overview of the RAMP framework, which provides a\nplatform to organize reproducible and transparent data challenges.\n\nRAMP workflow is a python package used to define and formalize the data\nscience problem to be solved. It can be used as a standalone package and\nallows a user to prototype different solutions. In addition to RAMP\nworkflow, a set of packages have been developed allowing to share and\ncollaborate around the developer solutions. Therefore, RAMP database\nprovides a database structure to store the solutions of different users\nand the performance of these solutions. RAMP engine is the package to\nrun the user solutions (possibly on the cloud) and populate the\ndatabase. Finally, RAMP frontend is the web frontend where users can\nupload their solutions and which shows the leaderboard of the challenge.\n\nThe project is open-source and can be deployed on any local server. The\nframework has been used at the Paris-Saclay Center for Data Science for\nsetting up and solving about twenty scientific problems, for organizing\ncollaborative data challenges, for organizing scientific sub-communities\naround these events, and for training novice data scientists.\n\nThe RAMP (Rapid Analytics and Model Prototyping) framework provides a\nplatform to organize reproducible and transparent data challenges. We\nwill present the different framework bricks.\n",
