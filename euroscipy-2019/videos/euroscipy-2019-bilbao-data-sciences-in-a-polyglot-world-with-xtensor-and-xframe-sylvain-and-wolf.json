  "description": "In this presentation, we demonstrate how xtensor can be used to\nimplement numerical methods very efficiently in C++, with a high-level\nnumpy-style API, and expose it to Python, Julia, and R for free. The\nresulting native extension operates in-place on Python, Julia, and R\ninfrastructures without overhead.\n\nWe then dive into the xframe package, a dataframe project for the C++\nprogramming language, exposing an API very similar to Python's xarray.\n\nFeatures of xtensor and xframe will be demonstrated using the xeus-cling\njupyter kernel, enabling interactive use of the C++ programming language\nin the notebook.\n\nThe main scientific computing programming languages have different\nmodels the main data structures of data science such as dataframes and\nn-d arrays. In this talk, we present our approach to reconcile the data\nscience tooling in this polyglot world.\n",
