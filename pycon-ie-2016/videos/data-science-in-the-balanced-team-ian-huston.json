  "description": "The goal of a Balanced Team is to share ownership and responsibility\nfor the success of a project between team members. Each team member\nhas specific obligations to the team and a specific area of authority.\nUntil recently, designers, product managers and developers were the\nusual team members considered. In this talk I will explore how data\nscientists can function in a balanced team and discuss my experience\nworking as a data scientist on balanced teams at Pivotal Labs with our\nglobal clients. I will consider what obligations and authority a data\nscientist can provide as part of a balanced team and how this\nsituation differs from the usual jack-of-all-trades type data science\nwork. I will outline specific examples where data science can help\nuser centric design and product management, and where the practices of\nlean-startup and agile development can help accelerate analysis and\ndata science. Based on my experience building data science driven\nproducts with a global bank and European car manufacturers, I will\noutline what we tried, what worked and most importantly what didn\u2019t.\n\nIf you are a data scientist or need to work with one, this talk will\nequip you to understand how data science can be an integral part of a\nbalanced team.\n",
