  "description": "From implementing new research to validating results, running machine\nlearning experiments can often be a process of trial and error.\nTensorFlow is an open source computing framework that places state of\nthe art algorithms and tools into developers' hands, allowing you to\nrapidly iterate experiments, monitor their results and scale into\nproduction. We'll show you how to train machine learning pipelines from\nconception to release with TensorFlow.\n",
