  "summary": "I will present WCSAxes, a new framework for plotting astronomical data\nthat seamlessly handles the plotting of ticks, tick labels, and grid\nlines for arbitrary coordinate systems and projections. While originally\nwritten for with astronomical data, it can be used for any kind of map\nprovided that the projection and coordinate system can be represented by\na pixel-to-world transformation.\n",
  "description": "Astronomical data (whether images on the sky, or other data) are\ntypically stored with information about their corresponding projection\n(Gnomonic, Mercator, Conical, Aitoff, and *many* more) and coordinate\nsystem (Equatorial, Galactic, Ecliptic, and so on).\n\nI will present `WCSAxes <https://github.com/astrofrog/wcsaxes>`__, a new\nframework for plotting such astronomical data, developed as part of the\n`Astropy <http://www.astropy.org>`__ project. WCSAxes consists primarily\nof a `Matplotlib <http://www.matplotlib.org>`__ Axes sub-class that\nseamlessly handles the plotting of ticks, tick labels, and grid lines\nfor arbitrary coordinate systems and projections.\n\nAs an example, the following plot was produced with WCSAxes:\n\n.. figure:: http://www.mpia.de/~robitaille/chandra_avm_small.png\n   :alt: The Galactic center as seen by the Chandra X-ray observatory\n\n   The Galactic Center as seen by Chandra\n(Image Credit: NASA/CXC/UMass/D. Wang et al. -\nhttp://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2009/gcenter/)\n\nSince it is a sub-class of the Matplotlib Axes class, all the default\nMatplotlib methods such as plot, scatter, imshow, contour, as well as\npatches, lines, collections, and so on are supported, and WCSAxes - in\ncombination with Matplotlib's ability to accept arbitrary\ntransformations - makes it very easy to define whether the plotting\nshould apply to pixel coordinates, or a world coordinate system related\nto the data.\n\nWCSAxes has been designed as a framework that can be easily used in\nother Python tools, and it is planned for inclusion in\n`Glue <http://www.glueviz.org>`__, `APLpy <http://aplpy.github.io>`__,\nand other astronomical tools. While originally written for Astronomical\nimages, it should be easily extendable to any kind of map (such as\nEarth-based geospatial data) provided that the projection and coordinate\nsystem can be represented by a pixel-to-world transformation.\n",
