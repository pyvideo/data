  "description": "AI practitioners come from diverse backgrounds with varying degrees of Python software engineering experience. Maintaining engineering excellence across a large organization with this variance in skill set is a challenge. Come hear how Intuit has successfully addressed this challenge by leveling up engineering skills at scale and by building automatic code quality enforcement into our Python paved roads. We will also share a few of our most effective best practices and the tech stack it takes to make it all work, including Poetry, Pytest, Black, Flake8, and Mypy.",
