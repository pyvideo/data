  "description": "Every week, in every city, hundreds if not thousands of decisions, big and small, are being made about the places where we all live. Most of the time, these decisions are hidden behind old systems, arcane websites, or poorly formatted PDFs. With the power of Datasette, Python data tooling, and Github actions, you can quickly set up a low-or-no-cost city data pipeline, and help us all better understand the decisions being made where we live.",
