  "description": "Teaching is not merely reserved for academia - it happens everyday in tech. It takes on many forms from instructing an entire team to a new process or an informal knowledge transfer between two engineers. Many shy away from the opportunity, but can find that often the mentor can learn as much as the mentee.\n\nJoin me as we explore the importance of teaching in tech, where we will start with Bloom's Taxonomy as the driver for learning. From there, I'll provide examples and case-studies from my own experiences in tech and how I learn from those specific use-cases to generalize for future applications.",
