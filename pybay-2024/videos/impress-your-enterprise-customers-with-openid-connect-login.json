  "description": "When you sell a Python SaaS app, customers' first question will be, \"How do I log in?\". Are you committing the security faux pas of rolling your own authentication? Does your app only support password login? If you've integrated identity standards, do you understand how they work and how you can benefit from their full set of features? In this talk, you'll learn the principles of how to use OpenID Connect (OIDC) to secure a Django app for the first time or refresh your knowledge. OIDC allows enterprise customers' users to sign in with their corporate identity providers and facilitates social login with Google or Twitter. Show your customers how you're prioritizing their authentication needs by following secure open standards.",
