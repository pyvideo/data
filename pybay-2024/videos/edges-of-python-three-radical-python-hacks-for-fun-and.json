  "description": "Building complex software projects is hard, but the fun part of doing it is that it often pushes you to find non-obvious solutions to problems which seem radical at first, yet almost obvious in hindsight.  In this talk you learn some of the unusual Python tricks that we use at EdgeDB to write more efficient Python with fewer bugs, and which you can apply in your project next time you need to scratch a similar itch.",
