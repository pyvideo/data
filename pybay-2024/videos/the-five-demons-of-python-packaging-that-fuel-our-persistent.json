  "description": "Packaging is very likely Python's most widespread and persistent frustration. It has remained an unsolved problem for 20+ years. Is Python uniquely cursed in this category? Do we just need more tools? What if the ecosystem just standardized on {tool X}?\n\nIn this talk, Peter will explain why Python has a uniquely hard problem to solve, sitting in the crosshairs of 5 very different kinds of challenges. Ironically, each of these challenges can be traced back to a core strength or value of Python and its open source ecosystem.\n\nThis talk will not offer any new comprehensive solutions, but will hopefully will give a holistic perspective of the fundamental drivers of complexity around Python and packaging. This can hopefully help orient future discussions, help tool makers surface opportunities for collaboration and consolidation, and help users better understand which subset of the 5 demons of packaging they are fighting at any given point in time.",
