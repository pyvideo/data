  "description": "FULL TITLE:  \"Let's make a working implementation of async functions in Python 1.6; or, why to use newer Pythons\" \u2014 Christopher Neugebauer (PyBay 2024)\"\n\nOften I hear people lamenting that Python has too many features and that older versions of Python were better for that exact reason.\n\nTo make those people happy, we're going to pick apart the features of Python that enable the `async`/`await` syntax, layer by layer, until we happen upon a working implementation of coroutines that will function in Python 2.1.\n\nSomewhere in this talk will be some useful discussions about why recent syntactic developments in Python are a good thing actually, but let's not lie, you're reading this abstract for the stunt content. You'll get what you came for.",
