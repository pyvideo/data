  "description": "If you need to build a user interface for your Python code, many guides will tell you that your only options are to use the command line, or wrap your code in a web interface. However, there is another option - building a GUI interface. In fact, in some cases, a GUI app may be your *only* option. In this talk, you'll learn how to build a cross-platform GUI application to wrap your Python code, and how to use that GUI application to access device features that may not be accessible from a command line or web interface.",
