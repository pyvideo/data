  "description": "I \u2764\ufe0f playing group improv games, but I don't always have a group of humans available for playing. What if I could get a computer to play the games with me, by using a small language model? Let's give it a go in this interactive talk! \n\nI'll start by playing some improv games with the audience (willing volunteers needed!) and then bring in a language model to play the games with us. Let's see what sort of creativity computers can bring to the table, and have fun along the way!",
