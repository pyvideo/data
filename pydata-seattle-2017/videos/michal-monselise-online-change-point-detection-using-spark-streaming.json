This talk will explore the use of scan statistics to perform real time analysis on streaming data using Spark Streaming.\n\nAbstract\nScan Statistics is a distribution based methodology for detecting anomalous data. Unlike simpler methodologies like moving average and exponential smoothing that rely on previous data, we can perform a hypothesis test regarding the distribution of the data and thus perform the analysis in real time. Spark Streaming is a framework that lends itself well to this use case. This talk will introduce a Python package built for Spark Streaming that performs real time anomaly detection using various distributions of count data.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
