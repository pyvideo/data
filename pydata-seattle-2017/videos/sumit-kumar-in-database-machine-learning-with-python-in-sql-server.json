  "description": "Description\nSQL Server 2017 has built in AI capabilities that bring Python based intelligence to where the data lives.\n\nAbstract\nIn this session, we will take a deeper look at the SQL Server Machine Learning Services with Python and its enterprise grade advantages. This enables you to use the latest innovations from the open source Python world on your data that is securely stored in SQL Server and provides additional scale, performance, operationalization and management capabilities. We will walk through a demo to build and deploy a Python based machine learning application in SQL Server to predict how long a patient is likely to stay in the hospital at the time of getting admitted to the hospital.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
