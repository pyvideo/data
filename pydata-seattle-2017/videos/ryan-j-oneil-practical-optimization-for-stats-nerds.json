  "description": "Many models important to inferential statistics and machine learning use some form of optimization under the hood. For example, least squares regression and support vector machines are both implemented as simple optimization models. With the right tools in your hands, optimization can do so much more! This talk shows how to implement familiar statistical models directly using optimization solvers.\n\nKey take-aways\n-Many statistical techniques are based on some sort of optimization.\n-Optimization has lots of uses, such as solving decision models.\n-Learning to structure problems you already know for optimization solvers is a great way to understand them!\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
