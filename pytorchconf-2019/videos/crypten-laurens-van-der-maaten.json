  "description": "Practical applications of ML via cloud-based or machine-learning-as-a-service (MLaaS) platforms pose a range of security and privacy challenges. In particular, users of these platforms may not want or be able to share unencrypted data, which prevents them from taking full advantage of ML tools. CrypTen is a new community-based research platform for taking the field of privacy-preserving ML forward.",
