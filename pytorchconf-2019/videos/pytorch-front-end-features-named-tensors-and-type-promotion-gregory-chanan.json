  "description": "Cornell University\u2019s Sasha Rush has argued that, despite its ubiquity in deep learning, the traditional implementation of tensors has significant shortcomings, such as exposing private dimensions, broadcasting based on absolute position, and keeping type information in documentation. He proposed named tensors as an alternative approach. PyTorch now supports the ability to name tensors, allowing for clearer code with less need for inline comments.",
