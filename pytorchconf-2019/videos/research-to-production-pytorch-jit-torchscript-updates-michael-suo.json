  "description": "TorchScript allows developers to create serializable and optimizable models from PyTorch code. Any TorchScript program can be saved from a Python process and loaded in a process where there is no Python dependency. Using TorchScript and the PyTorch JIT compiler, organizations and businesses have been able to use PyTorch not just for state-of-the-art research, but also to more easily take their trained models to production.",
