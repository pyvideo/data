  "description": "Object Orientation (OO) is often introduced in terms of how it is\nimplemented by a specific language. However, understanding the theory\nunderlying OO is not quite the same as understanding how OO concepts are\nsupported by a particular language. It is insightful to understand the\nsimple OO fundamentals and how these map to the particular\nimplementation provided by Python.\n\nIn this talk I will first explain the very basics of OO from a\nlanguage-neutral point of view with the aim of showing what OO can offer\nyou. I will touch upon the simple mathematical theory underlying OO and\nhow it can be used as a mental discipline to improve your natural\ncapacity to reason about programs. I hope to give you enough information\nto help you distinguish between better and worse designs and to detect\nwhether you're using OO as it was intended. I will show how these\nfundamentals map to Python, and compare the difference of Python's\nimplementation to that of some other languages (even functional\nlanguages).\n\nThis talk is for anyone: whether you're new at Object Orientation, or a\npractitioner wondering whether OO is worth the effort you've spent\ntrying to use it.\n",
