  "description": "`Apache Kafka <http://kafka.apache.org/>`__ is great for building a\nlarge scale distributed data bus. Even a small cluster will happily\naccept and store thousands of messages per second, and make them\navailable to consumers with low latency.\n\nKafka was chosen as the solution to our publish-subscribe infrastructure\nat `Takealot.com <http://www.takealot.com/>`__. It supports our\nevent-driven systems on the website, in the warehouses and in the\noffice, as well as our analytics and machine learning projects.\n\nThis talk will\n\n-  introduce the basic Kafka principles that make things work,\n-  outline how Kafka fits in with the rest of our architecture,\n-  cover some of the practicalities of building Python-based Kafka\n   services,\n-  compare the two main Python libraries for Kafka, namely\n   `kafka-python <https://github.com/mumrah/kafka-python>`__ and\n   `pykafka <https://github.com/Parsely/pykafka>`__,\n-  demonstrate some practical applications at Takealot.com.\n\nJoin in if you are interested in scalable distributed infrastructure.\n",
