  "description": "When we think about scientific programming, we often focus on complex\nhigh-performance applications for performing simulations of chemical\nprocesses, or on data analysis tools. It is easy to overlook the gaps\nbetween tools, such as format conversions, which may be simple for a\nprogrammer to automate, but require hours of tedious work for a\nresearcher without programming experience.\n\nIn this talk I will present a specific example of an application which\nfills such a gap in a medical research laboratory, where readings of\nchemical samples are used to measure the response of TB-causing bacteria\nto various drugs. The readings must be converted from the raw format\nproduced by the instrument in the laboratory into a format suitable for\nuploading into an online tool for further analysis.\n\nI will also discuss more broadly how research institutions can improve\nefficiency by collaborating with programmers and by encouraging\nresearchers to acquire basic programming skills.\n",
