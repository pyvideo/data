  "description": "Unit testing can be more effective and less tedious when you have an\narmy of robot monkeys at your disposal. Why should humans have to worry\nabout finding the particular combination of Turkish and Tengwar that\ncrashes the serialiser, or the convoluted sequence of operations that\ncorrupts the database?\n\n    ::\n\n        Hypothesis is a Python library for turning unit tests into generative tests,\n        covering a far wider range of cases than you can manually. Rather than just\n        testing for the things you already know about, Hypothesis goes out and\n        actively hunts for bugs in your code. It usually finds them, and when it\n        does it gives you simple and easy to read examples to demonstrate.\n\n    -- Hypothesis 1.0 release announcement\n\nProperty-based testing lets you think about your tests in terms of\ngeneral behaviour and invariant properties instead of getting lost in\nthe details of individual examples, and good tools (such as Hypothesis)\nwill explore quite complex combinations of test data and reduce them to\nminimum failing cases.\n\nThis talk will provide a practical introduction to property-based\ntesting with Hypothesis, and show how you can use it to build more\neffective test suites with less effort.\n",
