  "description": "JupyterHub has a range of documentation that covers both developer and user audiences in order to help them deploy, maintain, and use their own instance of a JupyterHub. The success of an open source software project to (i) be adopted by users, and (ii) receive meaningful contributions relies heavily on the quality, navigability and accessibility of documentation so that users and developers have all the information they need to achieve what they want to do.\n\nA framework for organising technical documentation has arisen called Di\u00e1taxis. It takes a systematic approach to understanding user requirements of documentation throughout the lifecycle of interaction with a product and posits that different user needs require different approaches in creation of the documentation, as well as a layout to navigate these different \u201cmodes\u201d of documentation.\n\nBetween December 2022 and March 2023, the JupyterHub project will be participating in the December 2022 round of Outreachy internships with the aim of improving its documentation. The project focuses on refactoring the documentation for the JupyterHub package. As the intern in charge of this process, my work began by performing a review of the present documentation, categorising these into the diataxis framework, and then restructuring the documentation files in the repository. Once the documentation is transformed into this framework, it will be easier to identify missing and unclear documentation (those that were difficult to categorise). Subsequently, the JupyterHub team can curate resources that can fill the gaps and improve documentation that is not specific enough.\n\nThis undertaking is not without its challenges, joys, and lessons, which can be extrapolated to other open-source documentation projects. The proposed talk will focus on highlighting these areas from the point of view of the JypyterHub Outreachy intern as well as their lead mentor. Specifically, it will seek to cover three main points within the allocated talk time:\n\nWhat is the importance of well-written and -structured documentation to an open-source project and to JupyterHub, specifically?\nWhat is the Diataxis framework and why did JupyterHub select to use it to restructure its documentation?\nWhat lessons can other open-source projects learn from JupyterHub\u2019s experience to make clear and well-structured documentation?\nThe talk targets anyone who authors or contributes to open-source software documentation, including technical writers and team leads. The audience can be working with any programming language but should have intermediate knowledge of technical writing practices, including what it entails and some of the tools used.",
