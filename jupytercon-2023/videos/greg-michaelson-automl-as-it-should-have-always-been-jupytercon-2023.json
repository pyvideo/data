  "description": "When AutoML was popularised during the 2010s, there was a great hope that the citizen data scientist would take over machine learning and that business analysts everywhere would soon be building thousands of advanced AI-based solutions, ushering in the age of AI in business. Not only did that not happen, but even the name \u201cAutoML\u201d has become sullied along with the myth of the citizen data scientist. In this talk, Greg will discuss the launch of a brand new open source project that promises to deliver AutoML as it should have been: open, flexible, code-based, and targeted at the only people generating value from machine learning \u2014 data science experts.",
