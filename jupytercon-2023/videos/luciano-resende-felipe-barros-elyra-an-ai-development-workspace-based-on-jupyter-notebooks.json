  "description": "Do you love Jupyter Notebooks, but are getting tired of the Wild Wild West of external tools and devOps tasks that consumes a lot of your time away from model development? In this talk, we will introduce you to Elyra, an open-source AI development workspace that enables data scientists, Machine Learning Engineers, and AI developers to be more productive. It provides support for low code/no code AI Pipelines integrated with Apache Airflow and Kubeflow runtimes, integrated Python, Scala, and R editors, collaboration support via git integration, code reusability via code snippets, etc all without having to leave your Notebook workspace. After a quick introduction to Elyra's capabilities, we will dive into a live demo, showcasing how to build and execute a data pipeline in a few minutes.",
