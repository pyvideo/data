  "description": "This talk presents Taipy, a new low-code Python package that allows you to create complete Data (Science) applications, including graphical visualization and the management of data, algorithms, models, and pipelines.\nIt is composed of two main independent components:\n* Taipy Core\n* Taipy GUI.\n\nTaipy GUI enables any Python developer to build highly interactive graphics in no time.\n\nSimilarly, Taipy Core provides a natural way to develop and create your pipelines with Caching, Versioning, Scenario management, etc.\n\nEven though Taipy Core and Taipy GUI can be used independently, they can be combined to develop very quickly powerful apps from your Jupyter Notebooks.",
