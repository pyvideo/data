  "description": "Voil\u00e0 can turn Jupyter notebooks into interactive dashboards without any modifications. This means that the millions of notebooks shared on GitHub and other online venues are just as many potential interactive dashboards. Unlike classical HTML-converted Notebooks, each user connected to a Voil\u00e0 dashboard gets a live Jupyter kernel that can execute callbacks, making the dashboard interactive using e.g. Jupyter widgets.\n\nIn this talk we will present the latest updates on the Voil\u00e0 open-source project, including the recent move to using components from the JupyterLab project for the rendering, enabling support for rich mime type renderers. We will also demo the ongoing work on using in-browser Python kernels from JupyterLite.",
