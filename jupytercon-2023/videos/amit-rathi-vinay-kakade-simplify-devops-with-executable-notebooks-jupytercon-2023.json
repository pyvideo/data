  "description": "Today, Jupyter Notebooks are mostly confined to science, research & education. But notebooks can provide organizations with a powerful general-purpose \u201cexecutable documentation\u201d platform. A solid use case for this is DevOps & more specifically, IT incident response.\n\nTechnology teams usually have an on-call rotation with static wiki-style documentation to guide the on-call engineer. Jupyter Notebooks can replace static documentation with executable notebooks. E.g. \u201cfetch service logs\u201d and \u201crollback last deployment\u201d can simply mean executing a code cell that\u2019s available alongside the markdown instructions.\n\nWhat are the benefits of executable vs. static documentation for DevOps -\n\nQuick e.g. \u201ccheck DB latency\u201d is 1-click notebook code cell execution to plot latency graph vs. going to a third-party UI in the middle of an incidence\nPrecise e.g. \u201cpromote read replica to master\u201d can mean a series of steps & possibility of human error; codifying the steps in advance removes ambiguity & results in precise action.\n\u201cExecutable documentation\u201d is a simple yet powerful concept that can extend to other use cases such as - API documentation, developer onboarding, data visualization & reporting, scheduling routine tasks & so on. Think of it as executable GoogleDocs powered by Jupyter!\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019d like to,\n- Introduce the concept of Jupyter powered \u201cexecutable documentation\u201d platform, particularly for DevOps and Incident Response,\n- Show a demo of how it\u2019d work - (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLXSAHCGF8)\n- Talk about important challenges, and propose a way forward to make this a mainstream application of Jupyter notebooks.",
