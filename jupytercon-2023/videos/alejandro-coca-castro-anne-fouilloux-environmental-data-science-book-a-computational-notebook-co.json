  "description": "Environmental Data Science Book (or EDS Book) is a pan-european community-driven resource hosted on GitHub and powered by Jupyter Book. The resource leverages executable notebooks, regional cloud resources and technical implementations of the FAIR principles to support the publication of datasets, innovative research and open-source tools in environmental science. EDS book provides practical guidelines and templates that maximise open infrastructure services to translate research outputs into curated, interactive, shareable and reproducible executable notebooks which benefit from a collaborative and transparent reviewing process. Each notebook and its dependencies (input/output data, documentation, computational environments, etc.) are bundled into a Research Object (RO) and deposited to RoHub (a RO management platform) that provides the technical basis for implementing FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) executable notebooks.\n\nTo date, the community has successfully published multiple python-based notebooks covering a wide range of topics in environmental data science. The notebooks consume open-source python libraries e.g., Pangeo stack (intake, iris, xarray) and Holoviz (hvplot, panel) for fetching, processing and interactively visualizing environmental research.\n\nIn future work, we expect to increase contributions showcasing scalable and interoperable open-source developments in other programming languages e.g Julia and R, and engage with computational notebooks communities and research networks interested in improving scientific software practices in environmental science.\n\nWhat is the EDS book?\n\nA book: https://edsbook.org\nAn open source project: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/environmental-ds-book\nA community: EDS book is also an open-source collaborative project that involves and supports its members of diverse skills and backgrounds to ensure that data science is accessible and useful for everyone interested in Environmental sciences.\nImpact and outreach over last 12 months\n\n10 executable notebooks (see the gallery in https://edsbook.org/notebooks/gallery.html)\n24 contributors in the GitHub Host Repository\n240 Twitter followers | 23 Mastodon followers\nHighlighted in the Supporting Pangeo: the community-driven platform for Big Data geoscience project page, https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/supporting-pangeo-community-driven-platform-big-data-geoscience\nHighlighted in a FOSS4G 2022 workshop aiming to teach the basics of Pangeo, an open-source stack suited for big geoscience data https://pangeo-data.github.io/foss4g-2022/afterword/envds-book.html\nOutreach\n\nWorkshops/Hackathons\n- Climate Informatics 2023 Reproducibility Challenge.
