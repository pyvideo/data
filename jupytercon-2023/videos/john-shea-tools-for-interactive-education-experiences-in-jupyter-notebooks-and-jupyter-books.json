  "description": "n this talk, I will introduce some simple-to-use libraries for providing interactive educational experiences in Jupyter notebooks and Jupyter Books. These tools are designed to support low-stakes testing and spaced repetition, which are two techniques that pedagogical research has shown support learning and retention. JupyterQuiz allows the simple creation of interactive self-assessment quizzes with custom feedback for answers that can help students understand why they are making a mistake. The typical use pattern is for question sets to be created and stored in a separate JSON file, but they can also be stored in an obfuscated format within a Jupyter notebook. Questions are delivered in Javascript to provide for interactivity, but the user does not need to know anything about Javascript. JupyterQuiz supports spaced repetition by allowing questions to be randomly drawn from a pool of questions, so that notebooks or book sections can randomly retest material from previous notebooks or sections. JupyterCards provides interactive, animated flash cards for review of terminology and concepts in Jupyter notebooks and Jupyter books. Cards can be created in either JSON or Markdown. Both libraries are free, open source, and easily installable via pip.",
