  "description": "Jupyter has long been proven to be a tool of choice in the data science and scientific computing\ncommunity. At NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, we have built upon those foundations to\nanswer engineering challenges and prove that with innovative approaches, the use cases that\ncan benefit from the Jupyter ecosystem are endless. With modular extensions and novel\nmethods, we are able to perform system-level and physics-based modeling, trade studies,\nautomated pipelines of engineering reports, hardware testing procedures, and more.\n\nIn this talk, we share our experience of using Jupyter as an integration platform and multi-domain\nengineering tool, and why we believe that with the correct approach, Jupyter can be extended\nto do just about anything.",
