  "description": "Have you ever heard about accessibility?\n\n3, 2, 1 \u2026.\n\nMaybe you have heard the term accessibility before in a particular context, but have you thought about how accessibility fits within the open source development? In this talk, we will dive into the efforts to make Jupyterlab and Jupyter interfaces accessible to a broader audience of users, including those users requiring assistive technologies. We will discuss ongoing efforts around robust accessibility testing framework for projects in the Jupyter ecosystem, addressing critical accessibility issues in Jupyterlab and developing documentation focused on best practices for accessibility compliance and disability inclusion. And, more importantly, how you can participate in making open source more accessible to all, whatever your role is: user, contributor, maintainer, advocate or any other.\n\nAt the end of the talk, the attendees will be able to:\n1. Have a basic understanding of accessibility and how it ties to open source software such as Jupyterlab.\n2. Learn about current efforts to make Jupyterlab more accessible.\n3. Get resources for learning more about accessibility and to engage with the accessibility efforts in the Jupyter ecosystem.",
