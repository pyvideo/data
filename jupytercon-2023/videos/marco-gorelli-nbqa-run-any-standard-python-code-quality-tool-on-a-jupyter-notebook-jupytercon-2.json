  "description": "There exists a tonne of Python code quality tools which can help catch bugs and fix stylistic issues. Unfortunately, the vast majority don't work out-of-the-box on Jupyter Notebooks. nbQA is a tool which addresses this issue, by allowing any standard Python code quality tool to be run on a Jupyter Notebook.\n\nIn this talk, you will learn:\n- how to use nbQA;\n- how nbQA works, and what its limitations are;\n- how you can use nbQA to run your own custom tools.",
