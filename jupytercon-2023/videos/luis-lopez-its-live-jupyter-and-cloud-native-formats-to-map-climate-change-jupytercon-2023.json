  "description": "ITS_LIVE ( https://its-live.jpl.nasa.gov/ ) is a NASA project that produces low latency, global glacier flow and elevation change datasets. The size and complexity of this data makes its distribution and use a challenge. To address these problems, ITS_LIVE was built for modern cloud-optimized data formats and includes easy-to-use Jupyter notebooks for data access and visualization.\n\nThis presentation will show how ITS_LIVE uses the Pangeo stack to generate Zarr data cubes that make fast access possible without the need of back-end services. We will also delve into our data access strategy and how we leverage and enhanced the Jupyter ecosystem by implementing native map projections and services in ipyleaflet to visualize big geospatial data in a matter of seconds.",
