  "description": "It\u2019s easy to become a software developer without ever having learned about software licences and how they might affect you (or your company!). It\u2019s also easy to assume that because code is available on GitHub or as a package in PyPI it\u2019s free to use with no restrictions. This usually isn\u2019t the case!\n\nIn this overview, you\u2019ll learn about different types of licences and how some are or aren\u2019t compatible with each other. Most of the focus will be on open-source licences, though I\u2019ll also discuss how open-source licences work with closed source code. We\u2019ll go over a few common licences in more detail so you understand your obligations when using code under that licence, and highlight some Python packages that use them.",
