It will examine the disconnect between what has been promised versus what\u2019s been delivered between radiology and artificial intelligence. A brief review of the most exciting and recent research and methodologies as applied to medical imaging will be performed. We will discuss how machine learning could be applied to the full spectrum of radiology workflow beyond simply computer assisted detection and characterization. There will be a broadly applicable discussion of the Top 5 problems and mitigations necessary for individuals and organizations bringing their A.I. solutions to a clinical setting. Finally, there will be a summary of datasets and Python resources that will assist interested developers in contributing to the growing medical imaging A.I. community. This material has not been presented previously elsewhere.",
