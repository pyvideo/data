  "description": "\"I'm burning out from all of these rude users!\" \"Why is my contribution being ignored?!?\" Phrases like these are unfortunately common in the world of open source. It all leads to frustrated users, contributors, and maintainers. Most of this negativity, though, stems from a misunderstanding from all sides of what should be expected from an open source project and those involved. The hope is that this talk will help re-calibrate how everyone involved in open source should view and interact with open source projects, leading to happier participants who want to be involved long-term in open source.",
