  "description": "With data more prevalent and accessible than ever, quantitative data analysis has become a core competency for the modern business and research analyst. Ironically, \u201canalysis\u201d is only part of the job of a bonafide data analyst: extracting, cleaning, exploring, wrangling, validating and visualizing are now equally as important.\n\nI come from a traditional analyst background where the primary technical skill required was Microsoft Excel. However I quickly found this limiting: data transformations I performed were not easily replicable; I couldn\u2019t query information housed in databases; nor could I scrape data tables from the web. Either I had to rely on others - typically engineers - to do this for me, or we decided not to do the analysis at all (ie. it wasn\u2019t \u201cfeasible\u201d).\n\nAfter a long and arduous process, I learned how to do most of these things myself and I\u2019m convinced most analysts would also benefit from embracing the \u201cengineering\u201d mindset. Analysts will always need domain expertise, but they must now increasingly embrace modern software development skills in their day-to-day job. They should be data experts first, and subject matter experts second.\n\nThanks to some great open-source libraries, the Python community is burgeoning with data analysts and scientists. In this talk we\u2019ll cover how to take your data from start to finish, including:\n\n* Extraction\n* Storage\n* Analysis\n* Visualization\n\nWe\u2019ll also touch on some less hard skills, such as data skepticism, sanity checking and exploratory data analysis. By the end of this talk, audience members should have a good understanding of the \u201cdata pipeline\u201d: all the steps required to get data from its raw, unrefined state to a structured and presentable story.",
