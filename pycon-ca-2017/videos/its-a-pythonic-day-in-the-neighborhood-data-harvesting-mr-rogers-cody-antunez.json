  "description": "Twitch.tv streams \u2018Mr. Rogers Neighborhood\u2019 aired for over 7 million viewers spanning 432 hours. Utilizing the Twitch API, WebSockets, IRC protocol, and Python, I created a bot that sat in-channel and collected both chat and user action events. This data was then analyzed to examine metrics of user engagement, audience reaction, retention rates, and keyword/phrase frequency in hopes to benefit future iterations of similar events.\n\nThe spirit and intent of this talk is to present a simplistic example of how I used python to: - communicate with the Twitch.tv API - build websockets - collect data (chat text, api calls, and scraping webpage info) - analyze data - create a fun python project that introduces the aforementioned subjects to both beginner and experienced pythonistas!\n\nPresentation page -- https://2017.pycon.ca/schedule/58/",
