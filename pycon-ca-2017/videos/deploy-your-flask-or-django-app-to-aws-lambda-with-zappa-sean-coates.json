  "description": "Zappa makes it easy to deploy your Flask or Django (or really, any WSGI app) to Amazon AWS Lambda, by hooking into AWS API Gateway.\n\nIn this talk, you'll get a brief introduction to how to use Zappa with your existing or upcoming projects, from how to install it to how to use it. If there's a stable connection, we'll even deploy a simple app during the talk, in only a few seconds.\n\nLambda is an inexpensive and very highly concurrent way to run \"serverless\" applications. I'm currently using this technology to deploy an application that has a concurrency of 10,000, for one of the largest companies in the world.",
