  "description": "Some of you might have been to my previous talk \"Click - A Pleasure to Write, A Pleasure to Use\", a brief overview of the powerful features provided by click to build command-line tools. You can find a recording of it on YouTube. But don't worry, I'll give you a super quick summary at the beginning of this talk.\n\nIn this talk, we will look at some more advanced features of click to build an example command-line tools. I will show you how nested commands make it easy to modularize your (complex) application and how you can use custom parameter types to improve validation. Come and join me for a journey into a world with no clicking but with a lot of click.\n\nPresentation page -- https://2017.pycon.ca/schedule/63/",
