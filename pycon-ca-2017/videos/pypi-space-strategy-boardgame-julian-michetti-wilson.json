  "description": "Let me tell you how I\u2019ve combined a raspberryPi, a projector, and a camera to create a strategy boardgame which handles the details for you.\n\nI'm going to take you step-by-step through how I built this game. In doing so I'll be answering the following questions: \n\n- Why even? and how did the idea evolve over time? \n- What obstacles did I encounter and how did I solve them?\n- What packages did I leverage?\n- How did I modularize components to make it multipurpose?\n\nI will focus less on the details of each function, and more on the way in which they were combined. It is my hope that attendees will \n\n1. gain a deep understanding of how the game works, and\n2. feel confident in their ability to design their own version, using this as a template",
