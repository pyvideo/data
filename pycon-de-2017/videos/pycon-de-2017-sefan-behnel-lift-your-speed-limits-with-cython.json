  "description": "**Sefan Behnel**\n\nStefan has been using Python since the beginning of the century and is probably best known as core developer of Cython and lxml. He spends his time joyfully writing Python and Cython code and teaching people like you how to make the best out of these tools.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nThink you can benefit from making your Python application run faster? Then come along and learn how to tune your code with Cython.\n\n**Description**\n\nCython is not just a Python compiler or a native code wrapping tool, but also a programming language in its own right that mixes Python with C and C++. The fact that you can simply drop Python code into it and compile it gives a very low entry level into performance optimisation by statically compiling your critical code and then tuning it into fast C to make it run faster.\n\nIn this talk, I will show a few use cases where the compilation of regular Python code leads to faster execution, and present ways how to make the code run much faster.\n\n\n**Recorded at** PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: https://de.pycon.org/\n\n**Video editing**: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan\n\n**Tools**: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",
