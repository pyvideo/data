summary: |-
  In recent years, the adoption of electric cars has resulted in a
  desperate need from carmakers for accurate range prediction. In
  addition, fuel efficiency is of increasing concern due to today’s
  ever-rising fuel costs. In this talk, we will outline a machine
  learning framework for real-time data analysis to demonstrate how
  live data collected from cars can be used to provide valuable
  information for range prediction and smart navigation.

  In recent years, the adoption of electric cars has resulted in a
  desperate need from carmakers for accurate range prediction. In
  addition, fuel efficiency is of increasing concern due to today’s
  ever-rising fuel costs. In this talk, we will outline a machine learning
  framework for real-time data analysis to demonstrate how live data
  collected from cars can be used to provide valuable information for
  range prediction and smart navigation.

  For our solution, we use a Bluetooth dongle that connects to a standard
  OBD II car diagnostics data port. Together with a self-developed iOS app
  we can then stream OBD II data into our framework’s big data
  infrastructure for long-term storage, batch training processes, and
  subsequent real-time analysis. We will show how we used different
  open-source technologies (Spark. Spring XD, Python and others) to
  stream, store, and reason over this data in a scalable way.

  In particular, we will focus on how we designed the machine learning
  framework to derive individual driver ‘fingerprints’ from variables such
  as speed, acceleration, driving times, and location, taken from
  historical data. These fingerprints are then used within the real-time
  prediction framework to determine final journey destination and driving
  behavior in real time during the journey. We will also look at how other
  public and free data sources such as traffic information, weather, and
  fuel station locations could be used to further improve the accuracy and
  scope of our models.

  This talk is intended to demonstrate pioneering work in the space of big
  data and the connected car. We will take into consideration the insights
  we have gained from building this prototype, both into infrastructure
  and analysis, to give our view on what such real-time driving
  intelligence applications of tomorrow could look like.
