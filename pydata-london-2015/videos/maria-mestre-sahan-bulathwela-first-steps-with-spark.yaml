  Intermediate\n\n\nDescription:\n-------------------\n\nSpark is a distributed computing\
  \ tool that offers many advantages over more established Hadoop frameworks. Apart\
  \ from its improved memory usage and flexibility, it provides a consistent framework\
  \ to do everything from ad-hoc big data analysis to the construction of a data processing\
  \ pipeline in production.\n\nAbstract:\n-------------------\n\nThe data science\
  \ team at Skimlinks has been using Spark for over a year. We will share some of\
  \ our experience of how to do large-scale data analysis using Spark stand-alone,\
  \ going from its basic functionality to more advanced features.\n\nWe will first\
  \ give an introduction to Spark, explaining how computations are distributed across\
  \ the cluster using resilient distributed datasets (RDDs). A high-level understanding\
  \ of how a workload is split into stages and tasks is important to be able to diagnose\
  \ potential problems. After showing how to get started on a cluster of EC2 instances,\
  \ we will go through a complicated part of using Spark: how to set its configuration\
  \ parameters.\n\nDuring the first half of the talk, we will focus on Spark core\
  \ functionality, going through some of the most common problems encountered during\
  \ basic computations. Using an example from impression data, we will do large-scale\
  \ text processing using popular ML Python libraries.\n\nIn the latter half of the\
  \ talk, we will focus towards using Apache Spark in practice by giving an overview\
  \ of building a large data processing pipeline that ingests and summarises terabytes\
  \ of data on a daily basis. Many non-technical departments such as Business Intelligence\
  \ and Marketing are familiar with Python and SQL. We will demonstrate how Spark\
  \ SQL and Dataframes can be used to query over terabytes of data on the fly."
