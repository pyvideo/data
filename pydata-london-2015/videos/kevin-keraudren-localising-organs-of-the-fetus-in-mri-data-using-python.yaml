  What if medical scanners could localise organs in 3D data in the same way as your camera automatically detects faces? The task is even more challenging for a fetus, whose orientation is arbitrary! In this talk, I will present how scikit-learn's Random Forest and the Python ecosystem can be used to solve this problem, wrapping a medical imaging C++ library with Cython along the way.

  Imaging the developing fetus
  ----------------------------

  The main challenge when imaging the fetus using Magnetic Resonance
  Imaging (MRI) is fetal movement. Acquiring MR images requires time,
  during which the fetus is unlikely to stay still. To address this
  problem, images are acquired as stacks of 2D slices that freeze in-plane
  motion and motion that occurred between slices is corrected
  retrospectively. Several stacks of 2D slices acquired in orthogonal
  directions are used to reconstruct a high resolution volume of the
  fetus. The automated detection of the fetal organs can help this problem
  by selecting a region of interest around parts of the fetal body that
  move as a rigid body. In this talk, I will present the pipeline I
  developed to localise the brain, heart, lungs and liver of the fetus in
  MR images, which can be used as pre-processing step for motion
  correction.

  Localising the brain of the fetus
  ---------------------------------

  The brain is first detected in each 2D slice using a Bag-of-Words
  approach with SIFT features, before accumulating the detection results
  with RANSAC in order to position a 3D bounding box around the brain.
  This bounding box is later refined into a segmentation, which is used
  for motion correction. The code, an example dataset and the associated
  publications can be found online [1].

  The OpenCV Python wrapper is used for feature extraction, while an SVM
  from scikit-learn takes care of the machine learning aspect of the
  Bag-of-Words. Scikit-learn's Random Forests, trained with patches from
  the central region of the brain bounding box and patches outside the
  bounding box, are used to refine the box detection into a segmentation.
  Medical images combine voxel data with scanner coordinates, which are
  used to align successive scans to each other. In order to correctly
  handle these coordinates throughout the Python code, as well as easily
  access medical image processing functionalities, a wrapper for the IRTK
  library [2] was developed using Cython. An image object is a subclass of
  numpy arrays. In particular, the function ``__getitem__`` is overloaded
  in order to update the scanner coordinates each time the image is
  cropped or sliced.

  Localising the heart, lungs and liver of the fetus
  --------------------------------------------------

  The location of the brain can be used to guide the search for other
  organs of the fetus. The heart, lungs and liver are detected using a
  two-step Random Forest approach: a first classification step assigns
  each voxel to an organ, and during a subsequent regression step, voxels
  vote for the position of the organ center. Steerable cube features,
  which can be efficiently computed using integral images, are used as
  input for the Random Forests. While all fetuses are aligned at training
  time, at test time image features are extracted in a coordinate system
  estimated as organs are detected: first the brain, which fixes a point,
  then the heart, which fixes an axis, and finally the liver and both
  lungs.

  Scikit-learn's Random Forests are not designed for parsing images. They
  can however be used in a research prototype by precomputing features for
  batches of voxels. This approach allows the researcher to focus on the
  detection pipeline and the feature extraction step. Example localisation
  results are presented in an online video [3].
