This talk will give you the advanced knowledge you need to take\ncontrol of your git repository: rebase, cherry-pick, bisect, blame,\nsquashing, and the reflog. You'll also get a better conceptual\nunderstanding of how git works, allowing you to chain these tools\ntogether to accomplish whatever task you need.\n",
