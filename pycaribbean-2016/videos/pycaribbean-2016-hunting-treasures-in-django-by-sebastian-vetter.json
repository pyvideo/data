  "description": "Django is a comprehensive web framework that provides well-defined concepts such as request, response, middleware and view that make our lives as perfectionists with deadlines much easier.

Decorators, helper functions and context managers that are used internally but can make life as a developer much easier as well.\"\n\n- Sebastian Vette",
