  "description": "Want to understand the \u201cmagic\" behind speech recognition, image manipulation, and data compression? The world is full of signals, and digital signal processing (DSP) allows us to interpret and manipulate them, leveraging the power of computers. Images, audio, video, temperature, tweets, anything measurable in time and/or space can be represented as a digital signal, and analyzed using DSP. Learn what DSP is, and how you can use it to look at data, and the world around you, with a new critical eye.\n\n\"DSP has a reputation of being hard to learn, but you do not need profound analytical skills or an extensive background in mathematics to grasp the fundamental concepts. If you know basic algebra, and you know what a sine wave is, you can learn the basics of DSP.\n\n\"There are some great python libraries for employing DSP. I will provide examples using Python and the SciPy package. \"\n\n- Amy Boyl",
