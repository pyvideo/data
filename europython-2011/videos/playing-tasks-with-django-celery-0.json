This talk will\nalso focus on how we use Celery at Jamendo and our real solutions to some\ncommon issues you may encounter when developing a back-office based on Celery.\n\nThe talk will cover the following topics:\n\n  * A brief overview of Celery and the AMPQ protocol AMPQ protocol overview, Celery introduction: Celery, RabbitMQ code examples\n\n  * The impact of Celery on the Jamendo work-flow; examples with real tasks. Here I will talk about the Jamendo back-office infrastructure and some of our common tasks. I will discuss the improvements made by introducing a new back-office system based on Celery. I will show some code snippets and go over some real scenarios.\n\n  * Overview of the Django Celery admin interface and some Jamendo extensions. Let's talk about the Django-Celery interface that allows one to monitor or schedule tasks directly from the Django admin. I will explain which common additional features are necessary and how to add them.\n\n  * Common \"gotchas\" we encountered while working with Celery and how we solved them.\n\n  * Global task locks\n\n  * Centralized logging: be able to read all the logs of all celery workers on different servers and filter them for real-time debugging\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": ["celery", "distributed", "django", "infrastructure", "queueing", "rabbitmq", "real-time", "web"], "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAXz2kbh_3U", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "[EuroPython 2011] Mauro Rocco - 22 June 2011 in \"Track Tagliatelle \"\n\n", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/mAXz2kbh_3U/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
