  "description": "How can Python help you deploy web applications to the cloud? Amazon EC2\nprovides virtual machines on demand but as a developer you still have to\nconfigure these machines and push your code to them. Fabric is a Python\nlibrary that lets you execute commands on a remote machine, and Boto is\na Python library for interfacing with Amazon web services. By using\nFabric and Boto, you can easily create repeatable deployments and\nprovision new resources as needed with minimal effort.\n\nThis talk will introduce Amazon Web Services and how to launch new\nmachines using simple Boto scripts, and how to get started making your\nown repeatable deployments using Fabric scripts.\n",
