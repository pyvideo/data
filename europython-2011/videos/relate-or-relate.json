So no one-\nsized fits all comparison will do. So, I'll try to outline a general taxonomy\nfor persistence mechanisms, and then proceed to comparing relational DB's to\ntheir new friends in practice.\n\nThe talk will contain quite a few stories from the trenches with CouchDB,\nMongoDB, MySQL, Postgres, Tokyo Cabinet, ZODB, and other databases, and will\nhelp you think about the data storage needs of your applications in new ways.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": ["database", "nosql", "optimizing", "performance"], "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZCANK4by0Q", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "[EuroPython 2011] Mark Ramm-Christensen - 21 June 2011 in \"Track Spaghetti\"\n\n", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/rZCANK4by0Q/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
