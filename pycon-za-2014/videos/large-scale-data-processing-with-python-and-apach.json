  "summary": "Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale, distributed\ndata processing. It offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala and Python as\nwell as a rich set of libraries including stream processing, machine\nlearning, and graph analytics. Spark is currently one of the most\nexciting and fastest-growing Apache open source projects. This talk will\ngive an overview of the Apache Spark project and introduce the basics of\nPySpark, the Python API for Spark. It will then dive a little deeper\ninto PySpark internals, and finally show some examples and a live demo\ncovering PySpark, Spark's SQL engine, and machine learning with Spark's\nbuilt-in libraries as well as other Python libraries.\n",
