  "description": "Building a machine learning model that runs locally on a laptop probably\nisn't generating any value, you have to get that model into production.\nThis talk will focus on getting Data Scientist and Data Engineers more\ncomfortable with the Machine Learning Lifecycle, and how the open source\ntool MLflow can help. Let's take our machine learning models to\nproduction and beyond!\n\nIntroduction\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n-  What is the machine learning lifecycle?\n-  Why should I care about this?\n\nWhat is MLflow?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n-  High-level overview of this open source Python project\n\nWhat is model tracking?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n-  Demo how MLflow can easily be used to track and record experiments\n\nHow to build a reproducible project?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n-  Demo how to use MLflow to be able to reproduce model building\n\nHow to create models that can be run anywhere?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n-  Demo building a model with Apache Spark and deploy on a non-Apache\n   Spark cluster.\n",
