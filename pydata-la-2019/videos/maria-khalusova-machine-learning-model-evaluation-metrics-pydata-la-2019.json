  "description": "Choosing the right evaluation metric for your machine learning project\nis crucial, as it decides which model you\u2019ll ultimately use. How do you\nchoose an appropriate metric? This talk will explore the important\nevaluation metrics used in regression and classification tasks, their\npros and cons, and how to make a smart decision.\n\nIn this talk, we'll go through evaluation metrics for regression tasks\n(R squared, MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RMSLE) and classification tasks\n(Classification accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC/AUC,\nPrecision/Recall AUC, Matthews Correlation Coefficient, and ways to\nextend some of these from binary to multiclass problems). I'll talk\nabout the differences between them, the trade- offs, and when some may\nbe more helpful than others.\n",
