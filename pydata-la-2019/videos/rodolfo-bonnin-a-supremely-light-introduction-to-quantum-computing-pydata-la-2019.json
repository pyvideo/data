  "description": "Quantum Computing is here and now, and its uses for solving real-world\nproblems is getting nearer. This talk will give you the tools to\nunderstand the main concepts of Quantum Information, and even perform\nyour first steps by running your own programs on real hardware using\nQiskit and Rigetti Forest.\n\nQuantum Computing is one of the most disruptive and fast-paced\ndisciplines of the present time.\n\nFor Data Science practitioners, understanding the main elements of the\nnew paradigm (Superposition, measurement, entanglement, Qubits, etc) can\nbe a daunting task. In this talk, we will walk through all these\nconcepts and will use Python to understand and probe them.\n\nThe talk will focus on direct and math-light examples, with accompanying\npython code examples illustrating the differences between simulating the\nquantum world ideally, an then observing introduced error of running\ncode in the noisy environment of real IBM and Rigetti's devices.\n\nThe outline of the talk is as follows:\n\n-  The need for a new kind of computing\n-  Quantum phenomena and how it can be used for computing.\n-  Quantum circuits and algorithms: Manipulating quantum data.\n-  Simulating and real hardware running of Python-based examples\n   (Qiskit, Rigetti Forest SDK, Pennylane)\n-  Conclusion\n",
