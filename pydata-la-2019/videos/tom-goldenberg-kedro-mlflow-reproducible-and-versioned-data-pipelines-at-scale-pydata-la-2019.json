  "description": "Kedro is a development workflow tool open sourced by QuantumBlack, a\nMcKinsey company. Many data science teams have started using the library\nfor their pipelines but are unsure how to integrate with other model\ntracking tools, such as MLflow. In this tutorial, we will give an\noverview of Kedro and MLflow and demo how to leverage the best of both.\n\nThe goal of this session is to demonstrate how Kedro and MLflow fit\ntogether in a scalable AI architecture. To start, we will give an\noverview of Kedro and an overview of MLflow: - What are they used for? -\nWhat functionality do they provide? - How do they compare as tools?\n\nNext, we will walk through a demo of a Kedro project that has MLflow\nintegrated into it. Finally, we will go over deployment options.\n\nThere will be time allocated at the end for Q&A.\n",
