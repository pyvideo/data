  "description": "Computer vision algorithms, which process video and image data, have\nmany applications. The development of convolutional neural networks,\nalongside hardware improvements, have led to a proliferation of highly\naccurate computer vision models. In this tutorial, you will learn how to\nbuild new, and use existing, computer vision models using PyTorch.\n\nThis tutorial is a practical, hands-on, introduction to computer vision\nwith PyTorch.\n\n| In this tutorial, you will learn about:\n| - An overview of deep learning for computer vision\n| - How to implement neural networks in PyTorch\n\n| You will gain hands-on experience with important computer vision\n  tasks:\n| - Image classification\n| - Object detection\n| - Semantic segmentation\n| - Generative models\n\nTutorial materials are available on GitHub in Jupyter notebook format.\n\nLaptops are encouraged, but not required.\n",
