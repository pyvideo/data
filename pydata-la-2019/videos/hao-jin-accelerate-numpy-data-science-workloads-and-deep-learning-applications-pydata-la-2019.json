In this talk, we\u2019ll cover creation of a multilayer perceptron\nmodel using gluon and MXNet\u2019s new NumPy-compatible functions, a port of\nthe classic NumPy with GPU accelerations and additional features for\ndeep learning. These open source tools will give you a working\nfoundation for building out more complicated models for real\napplications with faster performance and less hassle.\n",
