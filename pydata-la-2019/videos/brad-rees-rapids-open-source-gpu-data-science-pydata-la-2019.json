  "description": "See how RAPIDS and the open source ecosystem are advancing data science.\nIn this session, we will explore RAPIDS, the open source data science\nplatform from NVIDIA. Come learn how to get started leveraging these\nopen-source libraries for faster performance and easier development on\nGPUs. See the latest engineering work and new release features,\nincluding benchmarks and software development roadmap\n\nThe RAPIDS suite of open source software libraries gives the data\nscientist the freedom to execute end-to-end data science and analytics\npipelines on GPUs. RAPIDS is incubatedby NVIDIA based on years of\naccelerated analytics experience. RAPIDS relies on NVIDIA CUDA\nprimitives for low-level compute optimization and exposes GPU\nparallelism and high-bandwidth memory speed through user-friendly Python\ninterfaces. Through a familiar DataFrame API that integrates with a\nvariety of machine learning algorithms, RAPIDS facilitates common data\npreparations tasks while removing typical serialization costs. RAPIDS\nincludes support for multi-GPU deployments, enabling vastly accelerated\nprocessing and training on large dataset sizes.\n\nJoin NVIDIA\u2019s engineers as they walk through a collection of data\nscience problems that introduce components and features of RAPIDS,\nincluding: feature engineering, data manipulation, statistical tasks,\nmachine learning, and graph analysis.\n",
