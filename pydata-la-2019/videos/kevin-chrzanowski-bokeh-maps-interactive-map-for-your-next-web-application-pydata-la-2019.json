  "description": "Data scientists, analysts, and developers are proficient in creating\nstatic maps but what about interactive ones? An interactive map of Los\nAngeles neighborhoods will be made via Python\u2019s Bokeh library to show\nhow quickly one can be built.\n\nMaps are crucial for showing differences between regions. However, what\nhappens when users want to see regional changes over a range of time\nperiods for a variety of variables? One map may not be enough. Rather\nthan creating many maps for all your user\u2019s needs, an interactive map\nallows the viewer to choose the time period and variables of interest.\nIn order to get a better sense of the process of making an interactive\nmap, a map of Los Angeles neighborhoods will be built live using\nPython\u2019s Bokeh library.\n\nThe presentation will cover how to add features and widgets such as a\nhovertool, selection form, and mouse selection click to a map. We will\nalso go over the important modify\\_doc and update functions that are\ncrucial for an interactive map to be able to respond to input changes\nfrom a viewer. We\u2019ll deploy to a Google Cloud server, discuss when to\nbuild an interactive map, and best practices for designing one.\n\nKnowledge of certain data visual python libraries such as matplotlib or\nseaborn, in addition to basic python functionality, will be assumed.\nThis is a presentation geared for intermediate python users.\n",
