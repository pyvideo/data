  "description": "Have you emailed snippets of code with your colleagues, only to get\nstuck trying to find which email has the right code? In this tutorial, I\nwill demonstrate how to collaborate on code with others using Git. We\nwill cover branching, opening pull requests, doing code reviews,\nresolving code conflicts, and undoing any mistakes you may make along\nthe way. This talk assumes basic Git knowledge.\n\nPrerequisites\n=============\n\nThis tutorial will assume that participants have basic Git knowledge,\nthough anyone who is interested is welcome to attend. If you are\nunfamiliar with Git, I recommend `Software Carpentry's\ntutorial <https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-%20novice/>`__.\n\nWe will be doing some Git work together, so participants should have\n`Git installed <https://git-scm.com/>`__ and should have a personal\n`GitHub account <https://github.com/>`__. If participants would prefer\nto use a graphical interface, I recommend using\n`SourceTree <https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/>`__. Note that to install\nSourceTree, you will need to create a personal BitBucket account.\n\nMaterial\n========\n\nCollaboration\n-------------\n\n-  What happens when multiple people try to commit code at once?\n-  Using branches and merges\n\nPull requests\n-------------\n\n-  Opening issues in GitHub\n-  Creating a pull request\n-  Doing code reviews\n-  Fixing conflicts\n-  Merging your code back in\n\nFixing mistakes (as time permits)\n---------------------------------\n\n-  Reverts and resets\n-  Cherry-picking\n-  Whoops, I just committed my password...\n",
