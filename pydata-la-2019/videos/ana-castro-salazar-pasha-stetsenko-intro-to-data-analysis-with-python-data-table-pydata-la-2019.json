  "description": "In this tutorial, an introduction of Data Analysis with Python\ndatatable, one would learn about data wrangling with datatable via a\nbanking loan scenario using a subset of the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\ndatasets. We would show how to munge loan-level data, obtain basic\ninsights, exploratory data analysis, model development, and model\nevaluation.\n\nDuring the tutorial session, we would use a banking loan scenario using\na subset of the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac datasets where we would show\nhow to munge loan-level data. Additionally, we would give an overview of\nhow **Python datatable** is used to obtain basic insights that start\nwith data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, model development, and\nmodel evaluation.\n\n**Python datatable** is a library that implements a wide (and growing)\nrange of operators for manipulating two-dimensional data frames. It\nfocuses on: big data support, high performance, both in-memory and\nout-of-memory datasets, and multithreaded algorithms. Datatable\u2019s\npowerful API is similar to R data.table\u2019s, and it strives in providing\nfriendlier and intuitive API experience with helpful error messages to\naccelerate problem-solving.\n\n**Learn more about Python datatable:**\nhttps://github.com/h2oai/datatable\n\nPrerequisites\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n-  Basic knowledge of Statistics and Machine Learning\n-  Basic knowledge of Python\n-  JupyterLab\n-  Python datatable installed on your local machine or use cloud env:\n\n   -  datatable can be install by following:\n      https://datatable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html\n\n**Note:** As of now, datatable is only supported on Linux and Mac OS X.\nHowever, one can use it on Windows via a docker container.\n\nTutorial:\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n-  **Task 0:** Introduction to Python datatable(10 min)\n-  **Task 1:** datatable vs Pandas (10 mins)\n-  **Task 2:** Understand the dataset (10 mins)\n-  **Task 3:** datatable - Data Wrangling (10 mins)\n-  **Task 4:** datatable - Exploratory Data Analysis (10 mins)\n-  **Task 5:** datatable - Model Development (10 mins)\n-  **Task 6:** datatable - Model Evaluation (10 mins)\n-  **Task 7:** Q &A (10 - 15 mins)\n",
