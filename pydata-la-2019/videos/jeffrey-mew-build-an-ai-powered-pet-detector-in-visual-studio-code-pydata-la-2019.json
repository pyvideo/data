Let\u2019s build a pet detector\nservice to recognize them in pictures! In this talk, we will walk\nthrough the training, optimizing, and deploying of a deep learning model\nby using VS Code and the Azure Machine Learning service. We will use\ntransfer learning to recognize dog and cat breeds. Next, we\u2019ll optimize\nthe model using Azure Machine Learning service to improve the model\naccuracy. Putting on our developer hat, we'll then refactor the\nnotebooks into Python modules using VS Code. Finally, we will deploy the\nmodel as a web service in Azure, all from the comforts of VS Code. Come\nto see how Azure and VS Code makes AI and machine learning development\nand deployment easy.\n",
