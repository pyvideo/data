  "description": "Notebooks have traditionally been a tool for drafting code and avoiding\nrepeated expensive computations while exploring solutions. However, with\nnew tools like nteract's papermill and scrapbook libraries, this\ntechnology has been expanded to make a reusable and parameterizable\ntemplate for execution. We'll look at how to make use of this pattern\nfor Data and ETL processes.\n\nIntro\n~~~~~\n\n-  Myself, Netflix, and Why I'm here\n-  What does a Data Platform Team do?\n-  Projects and Open Source tools discussed in presentation Papermill,\n   Jupyter, nteract, etc\n\nNotebooks\n---------\n\nWhat are Jupyter Notebooks?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWe'll some visual examples and breakdowns of notebooks.\n\nHow Notebook Work\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nA guide through how a notebook executes and the model it uses to run\nyour code.\n\nTraditional Use Cases\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAround experimentation and code development.\n\nNew Use Cases\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFor production data and operations without full rewrites of Notebook\ncode.\n\nPapermill\n---------\n\nWhat is papermill?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n`papermill <https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ is a library\nfor executing notebooks programmatically.\n\nHow do you use it?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou'll see some examples in Python and with it's provided CLI.\n\nHow does it fit into the Notebook model?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWe'll relate the execution back into original Notebook execution\ndiagrams.\n\nHow to extend papermill\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nQuick pointer to the extensibility of the library and how to add new\nfunctionality.\n\nUsing papermill in production data pipelines\n--------------------------------------------\n\nOperationalizing Notebooks\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFailure analysis, Productionalization, Sharing executions...\n\nDags of Notebooks\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMaking a pipeline with Notebooks.\n\nIntegration Testing\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nGood practices Where unittesting doesn't fit\n\n@ Netflix usage\n---------------\n\nQuick blip about adoption and usage at Netflix.\n\nRelated libraries (time pending)\n--------------------------------\n\nScrapbook\n~~~~~~~~~\n\nCommuter / NBViewer\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n",
