  "description": "Python development has had a great emergence in development of\nstatistical packages, algorithms, and implementations. However, with the\ndevelopment and ease of practicing statistics & algorithms, there are\nstill some rules and constraints one must follow to obtain quality\nsolutions. And that is especially true with AB Testing, a statistical\nprocedure to provide data- driven insights in uncertainty.\n\nThis will be a breakout Session on frequentist AB Testing in python.\n\nWe'll explore the jungle of application and statistical methodology and\npractice with examples of Click Through Rates, the early metrics of\nchoice for AB Testing in production. That being said, compared to your\nlast statistics course you may have taken in the past, there are still\nsome rules and constraints one must follow to obtain quality solutions.\n",
