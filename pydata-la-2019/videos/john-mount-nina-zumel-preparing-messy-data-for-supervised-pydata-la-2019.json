  "description": "Cleaning messy data is a necessary component of data science projects.\nThe vtreat package automates common data preparation steps for\nsupervised machine learning. In this talk, we will introduce vtreat and\ndemonstrate its effective use with Pandas and xgboost on real-world\ndata.\n\nData characterization, treatment, and cleaning are necessary (though not\nalways glamorous) components of machine learning and data science\nprojects. While there is no substitute for getting your hands dirty in\nthe data, there are many data issues that repeat from project to\nproject. In particular, there are pitfalls in properly dealing with\nmissing data values, previously unobserved categorical values, and\nhigh-cardinality categorical variables.\n\nIn this talk, we will discuss using the vtreat package to prepare data\nfor supervised machine learning. We will demonstrate vtreat on a\nreal-world data set, with xgboost and Pandas. Vtreat automates the\nstatistically sound treatment of common data problems, leaving the data\nscientist free to concentrate on problem-specific data and modeling\nissues.\n",
