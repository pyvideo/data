  "description": "Want to use your data skills to empower an organization and influence\nyour companies strategy? Unfortunately its not as easy as just starting\na jupyter notebook and importing Tensorflow. Making your analysis change\nhearts and minds take more than math and code, and is more challenging\nthan just the algorithm. In this talk I'll share tips of how to make\nyour data work resonate across your org.\n\nMaking data relevant to your company isn't just math and code. Business\nskills are required as well. Many data folks, including myself in the\npast, underestimate these \"soft skills\" and end up feeling frustrated\nwhen your analyses don't have the recognition or impact that you expect.\n\nIn this talk I'll focus on the soft skills of data, and connect these\nskills to \"hard data\". These include topics such as , story telling,\ncoalition building, empathizing with stakeholders, making subjective\ncalls, and negotiation.\n\nIn particular I'll talk about my own failures and my most helpful\nresources outside of the data \"sphere\" which have helped me pick up and\npractice each of these topics. Ultimately by pairing these human skills\nwith your data skills you'll better be able to make your voice heard and\ninfluence that change that you're looking for.\n",
