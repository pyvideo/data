  "description": "AI and ML are becoming an essential part of software engineering. Open\nsource tools like Git, Git-LFS, MlFlow can increase ML teams\nproductivity by introducing best practices. However, large datasets\nmanagement and versioning are not covered by these tools. We will show\nhow to overcome the limitations of the tools by using DVC.org - an\nopen-source project for ML models and datasets versioning.\n\nAI and ML are becoming an essential part of software engineering. The\ntraditional engineering toolset does not fully cover machine learning\nteam's needs. The teams need new tools for data versioning, ML pipeline\nversioning, ML model versioning, experiments metrics tracking, and\nothers.\n\nML workflow is data-centric while software engineering workflow is\ncentered around source code. We will discuss the current practices of\norganizing ML projects using open-source tools like Git, Git-LFS, MlFlow\nas well as their limitations. Thereby motivation for developing new ML\nspecific data versioning systems will be explained.\n\nData Version Control or DVC.ORG is an open-source command-line tool. We\nwill show how to version ML models and multi-gigabyte datasets, how to\nuse your favorite cloud storage (S3, Google Cloud Storage, or bare metal\nSSH server) as a data file backend, how to apply the best engineering\npractices to your ML projects and how to combine the different tools in\nthe same project.\n",
