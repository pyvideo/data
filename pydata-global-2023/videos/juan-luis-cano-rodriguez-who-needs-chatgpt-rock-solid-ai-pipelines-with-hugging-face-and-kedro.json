These commercial systems are very sophisticated and powerful, but also a bit opaque if you want to learn how they work or adapt them to your needs. What happens inside the 'black box'?\n\nLuckily there are open AI models that you can download comfortably, study without restrictions, and adjust so that they do what you want. This requires some technical knowledge, but thanks to Hugging Face's models and their ecosystem of Python libraries, delving into AI is easier than ever.\n\nYou will soon find yourself combining different models, performing different tasks, and creating complex systems. But this complexity can grow very quickly, and soon you'll find yourself with spaghetti code if you are not careful. By using the Kedro catalog and Kedro pipelines, you will be able to organize the code in no time.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
