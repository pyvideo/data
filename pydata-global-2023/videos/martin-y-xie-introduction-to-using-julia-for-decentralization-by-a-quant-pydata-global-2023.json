However, being both easy and fast is just the \"syntactic\" feature and benefit. An extension or superset of Julia can unleash its \"semantic\" potential to provide value to every company going through digital transformation. We will discuss in more details with examples in the context of quantitative trading and hedge fund. We will also mention Julia's potential in combination with technology such as blockchain. We will release a new package as the first step towards an extension or superset of Julia for building decentralized systems.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
