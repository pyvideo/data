However, most data science projects and notebooks struggle at the most basic level of declaring dependencies correctly. A recent study showed that 42% of the notebooks executed failed due to missing dependencies.\n\nFawltyDeps is a dependency checker that finds imports you forgot to declare (undeclared dependencies), and packages you declared, but that are not imported in your code (unused dependencies).\n\nThis talk will guide you through integrating FawltyDeps in your manual or automated workflows and how this can improve the reproducibility of your notebooks and projects.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
