In this tutorial, I will demonstrate building a chatbot using OpenAI API and LLMs available on HuggingFace. Besides, I will talk about the advantages of using LangChain and the different strategies that can be used to configure your chatbot to yield the best responses. Not only that, the chatbot can also get you the relevant texts (basically the context) from which it derives the answers for transparency, validation and troubleshooting. Python libraries like OpenAI, HuggingFace, LangChain and Streamlit will be used in the majority of the tutorial to build this GenAI-powered chatbot.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
