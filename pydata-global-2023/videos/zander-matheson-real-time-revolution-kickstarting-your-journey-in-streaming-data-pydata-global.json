While some of these may sound true, the world of streaming data has come a long way and it is time we start to take advantage of data in real-time.\n\nThis talk dips your feet into the world of streaming data and demystifies some of the common misconceptions. We will cover some of the basics around streaming data and how you can get started with your first stream processing project with the Python open source stream processor Bytewax.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
