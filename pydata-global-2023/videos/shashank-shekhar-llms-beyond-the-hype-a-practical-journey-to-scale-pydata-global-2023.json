However, the cost associated with utilizing these LLMs can turn out to be very expensive. During this presentation, I will delve into practical strategies aimed at achieving a delicate balance: reducing inference costs while simultaneously elevating model performance, enhancing quality, and optimizing latency. Additionally, I will discuss essential architectural principles for constructing LLM-based systems and products, alongside pragmatic methodologies to fine-tune open-source LLM models, enhancing their performance in specific use-cases. I will also explore some practical evaluation methods for benchmarking models against baseline standards, delve into embedding techniques for precise query classification, and unravel the intricacies of shot-prompting strategies to bolster adaptability to unfamiliar data.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
