But what if instead you could build an application in the same environment where the data lives? With Snowflake\u2019s Native App Framework, you can build apps that run within Snowflake \u2013 right next to the data \u2013 using Python and Snowflake primitives. You can even monetize your app and drive revenue by distributing your app on the Snowflake Marketplace. In this session, Gilberto Hernandez, Lead Developer Advocate at Snowflake, will walk you step-by-step through building and deploying your first Snowflake Native App within Snowflake. To follow along in this lab, you\u2019ll need:\n\nA Snowflake account (create a free trial account at signup.snowflake.com \u2013 be sure to select AWS as the underlying cloud provider)\n\nA code editor\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
