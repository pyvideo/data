It turns out that more is possible than what you would expect! For example, at the most basic level, Jupyter supports basic syntax extensions like so-called \"magic\" operations. It turns out, however, that one can go much deeper. In this talk, I'll show that it's possible to augment and abuse Python to support a plethora of interactive use cases. I'll start with the simple example of building an optional chainer for Python (supporting syntax reminiscent of javascript like a?.b()?.c). I'll then show how to use these same ideas to accelerate data science operations, concluding with an example of how to perform full dataflow tracking in order to give users the illusion of dataframe queries that run instantaneously.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
