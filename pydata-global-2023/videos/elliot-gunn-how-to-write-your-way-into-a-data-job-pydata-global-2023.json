  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nWriting online remains an underrated career asset in data science and data engineering. A single well-crafted article can effectively showcase both technical and soft skills, and it can be a powerful tool for networking at conferences and engaging with recruiters. While students or new entrants to tech are often encouraged to create portfolio projects to showcase their skills, they often neglect the \"last mile\" of writing an accompanying piece and posting it somewhere online. Git repos can\u2019t convey what trade-offs were made, why you made certain tweaks to the model, and why you chose this data orchestrator over another. Writing about your data project helps verify that you truly understand the underlying ideas and have domain knowledge expertise. I have three goals for my talk: 1. Understand how \u201cexisting online\u201d still remains a massively underrated career asset\u2014and you only need 1 article to start 2. Learn how to write a strong portfolio piece that signals your technical skills and ability to communicate 3. Confidently use your published work in your job search to network more effectively, both online and offline\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
