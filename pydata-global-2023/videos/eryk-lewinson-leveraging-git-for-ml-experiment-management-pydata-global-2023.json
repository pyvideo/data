To keep track of these experiments, they employ setups of varying complexity, including physical notebooks, spreadsheets, or even complex configurations using various libraries and dedicated infrastructure. In this practical presentation, I will demonstrate how you and your team can start tracking experiments right away using a very simple setup, with most of the ingredients you are probably already using.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
