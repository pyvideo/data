  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nA shift is a poetic word for uncertainty. Winds shift, rivers and sands drift, and people change. Coming to the not-so-poetic world of data science, what about the data? Data comes from systems and people using them, so it is natural that data too will see the rigors of shift too. A model that was trained and tested for particular dynamics may assume the expected uncertainty in the data such as a shift in the user behavior. But what happens when the shift goes beyond expectations? How do teams detect the different types of data drift? More so, how do they tackle the detected drift? In this talk, I will gently introduce you to data drift and how the industry tackles this issue.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
