There is a plethora of innovative open source software that is made with little or no contribution from experienced designers, which often leads to inconsistent interfaces, confusing interactions, and ultimately, a poor user experience. When paired together, strong open source projects and human-centered, empathetic design thinking can create software that users can actually use. This session will explore the opportunities for design in open source projects and how developers can exercise a few design practices to influence the adoption and usability of their projects. It will examine what experience design is, why it matters, and the principles behind effective design. Attendees will learn through hands-on activities how to incorporate design thinking strategies into their projects without sacrificing design and how doing so will result in a better product for their users.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
