However, building and testing data pipelines can be challenging when the real data is not available, either due to privacy issues, technical limitations, or simply because the data is not yet collected. How can we ensure that our data pipelines are robust and reliable without having access to the actual data?\n\nIn this talk, we will share our experience of creating synthetic data to test data pipelines using Python. We will demonstrate how we used some statistical methods and Python packages such as Faker to generate realistic synthetic data for different use cases, such as customer profiles, transactions, and time series. We will also show how we used Flyway to load the synthetic data into a Postgres database and perform repeatable deployments. We will discuss the benefits and challenges of using synthetic data for testing data pipelines, as well as some best practices and tips for creating and using synthetic data effectively.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
