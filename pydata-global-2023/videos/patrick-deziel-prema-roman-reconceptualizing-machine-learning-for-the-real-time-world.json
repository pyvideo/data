While open source libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow are have gone a long way to democratize data science, they are also unintentionally limited by the assumptions and research focus of academia at the time they were released. One such assumption is that a model must be trained on batches of data and that all machine learning models need more data in order to perform well. This introduces a gap between training and inference as there is a requirement to accumulate enough instances for training. For real-time use cases such as anomaly detectors, models can become stale even before they get deployed to production.\n\nFortunately there has been a trend towards building machine learning models that are geared towards learning from streams of data and that can react immediately to changes in data. This form of learning is usually referred to as real-time machine learning, online learning, or incremental learning.\n\nIn this talk, we will compare the two approaches to machine learning, provide a brief overview of River, a library for building online learning models, and demo a real-time application using PyEnsign, a real-time data streaming client.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
