Yet, the actual value of data lies in its accessibility to non-data experts who can unlock its potential independently. Join us in this hands-on tutorial hosted by experts from Vizzu and Streamlit to discover how to transform data analysis into a dynamic, interactive experience.\n\nStreamlit, celebrated for its user-friendly data app development platform, has recently integrated with Vizzu's ipyvizzu - an innovative open-source data visualization tool that emphasizes animation and storytelling. This collaboration empowers you to craft and share interactive, animated reports and dashboards that transcend traditional static presentations.\n\nTo maximize our learning time, please come prepared by following the setup steps listed at the end of the tutorial description, allowing us to focus solely on skill-building and progress.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
