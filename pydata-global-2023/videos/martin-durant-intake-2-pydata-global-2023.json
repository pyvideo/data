  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nIntake is a python library for describing, cataloging, finding and loading data. It has had the ethos of \"load and get out of the way\", which limited scope but provided a lot of convenience. However, complexity built up over years, providing a barrier for new users to start with Intake. In this talk, I will resent Intake 2, a complete rewrite of the package, featuring a much simpler reader interface and removal of many complex and unused features. This overhaul also enabled the development of a general purpose data pipelining description, making intake both simpler and much more powerful.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
