K\u00f9zu's embedded architecture makes it very easy to import as a library without a server setup and also provides performance advantages. Specifically users can: (i) ingest and model their application records in various raw file formats as a graph; (ii) query and transform these graphs using Cypher query language; and (iii) export graphs into popular Python GDS packages with no copy cost. We will live demo K\u00f9zu's integration with NetworkX and Pytorch Geometric.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
