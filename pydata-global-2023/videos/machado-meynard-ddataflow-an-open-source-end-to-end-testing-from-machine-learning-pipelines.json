This talk will introduce DDataflow, an innovative open-source tool, designed to facilitate end-to-end testing in ML pipelines by leveraging decentralized data sampling. Attendees will gain insights into the challenges of unit testing in large-scale data pipelines, the design philosophy behind DDataflow, and practical implementation strategies to enhance the reliability and efficiency of their ML pipelines.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
