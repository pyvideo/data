By moving computation to data sources, it ensures privacy while enabling collaborative model training on vastly more data than before. This keynote introduces federated learning, demonstrates how Python developers can implement it in under 20 lines of code using the Flower framework (https://flower.dev), and provides an outlook on how federated learning will shape the next generation of machine learning systems\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
