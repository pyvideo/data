Some recent stacks and toolkits around Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agents, enabling users to build applications such as chatbots using LLMs on their private data. In this talk we do a comprehensive survey of both basic and advanced RAG techniques. We show you what RAG is and how to setup a simple version. We show you how to evaluate and optimize RAG systems. We then talk on advanced concepts (agents, fine-tuning), and help you think about how to build a full-stack LLM app.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
