These features describe key characteristics of the time-series using algorithms from statistics, econometrics, signal processing, and non-linear dynamics.\n\nThat's why we open-sourced functime: a new high-performance time-series machine-learning library. What makes functime special is it's written in the ground-up with polars, which is currently the world's fastest dataframe library built on Apache Arrow and Rust.\n\nfunctime recently rewrote 100s of features from tsfresh into Polars. The result? Up to 50x improvement in speed and memory efficiency compared to existing Pandas / Numpy implementations. functime is now the world's fastest time-series feature extraction library. Moreover, functime effortlessly parallelizes work for thousands of time-series using Polar's highly-optimized Rayon backend,. No distributed cluster (e.g. Spark). needed!\n\nThis talk begins with a brief introduction of time-series feature extraction and its use-cases. We then deep dive into the reasons why Polars is an optimal query engine for time-series feature engineering. We discuss the challenges and learnings from our rewrite. In particular, we will demonstrate, through code and benchmarks, lesser-known Polars tips and tricks to squeeze 10x speedups in your data engineering workflows.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
