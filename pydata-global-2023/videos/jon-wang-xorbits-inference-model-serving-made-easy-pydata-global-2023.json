Xinference, a state-of-the-art library, emerges as a game-changer in this domain, offering seamless model serving capabilities. This talk aims to delve deep into how Xinference not only simplifies the process of deploying language, speech recognition, and multimodal models but also intelligently manages hardware resources. By choosing an appropriate inference runtime based on the hardware and allocating models to devices according to their usage, Xinference ensures optimal performance and resource utilization.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
