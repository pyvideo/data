  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nThe goal of this workshop is to address the gap between the development of technical work -- whether that's via research or more traditional data science work -- and its reproducibility by providing attendees with the necessary knowledge to get started creating Python packages. This means that, if you're a researcher (with basic Python knowledge) wanting to make your theories more accessible via code, or a data professional wanting to share your Python code inside or outside of your organization, this workshop will help you understand how to contribute to, and develop, open-source projects from scratch.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
