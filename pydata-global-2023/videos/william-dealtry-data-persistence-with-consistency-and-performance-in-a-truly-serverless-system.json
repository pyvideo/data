  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nFully serverless systems are compelling for a number of reasons; they are inherently scalable, highly available and have a low maintenance burden. The challenge with a serverless system is providing sufficiently strong guarantees of data consistency without either sacrificing performance or simply shifting the burden of maintaining consistency to an external client-server system. At ArcticDB (https://github.com/man-group/arcticdb) we have spent years refining a fully serverless model that pushes the boundaries of what can be achieved with nothing but a python library and commodity object storage. In this talk we will share re-usable techniques for ensuring data reliability without external synchronization.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
