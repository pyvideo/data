However, its oft-quoted slowness has prompted many others like duckdb, polars, and RAPIDS cuDF to step in and offer faster alternatives. These are all fantastic tools, but they have non-zero adoption costs, more restrictive APIs compared to pandas, and they don\u2019t always work with 3rd party libraries that use pandas today.\n\ncudf.pandas takes a fresh approach: instead of trying to be a replacement for pandas, it effectively accelerates pandas on the GPU. cudf.pandas requires no code changes (not even your pandas imports!), supports 100% of the pandas API, and third-party libraries that use pandas are magically accelerated on the GPU.\n\nIf you use pandas today and want to run your code on the GPU with 0 changes today, this talk is for you. If you are the maintainer of a library that uses pandas and you\u2019d like to support GPUs with 0 changes today, this talk is for you. If you\u2019re a Pythonista at heart and enjoy hearing about the proxy pattern and deep import customization, this talk is for you!\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
