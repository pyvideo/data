It's also flexible and easy to specify row and column-based layouts. The components are intelligently re-sized to fill the browser and adapted for display on mobile devices. Finally, you can author using any notebook editor (JupyterLab, etc.) or in plain text markdown with any text editor (VS Code, RStudio, Neovim, etc.).\nDashboards can be deployed as static web pages (no special server required) or you can optionally integrate a backend Shiny Server for enhanced interactivity.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
