You will learn how to build your own AI-enabled real-time data pipeline without complex and fragmented typical LLM stacks such as vector databases, frameworks, or caches. We will leverage an open-source LLM App library in Python to implement real-time in-memory data indexing directly reading data from any compatible storage, processing, analyzing, and sending it to output streams.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
