It's lightweight like SQLite but powerful enough to deliver real-time semantic search over a billion vectors on a laptop.\nLanceDB is backed by Lance columnar format, which delivers up to 100x performance improvement over parquet for managing multimodal AI data (e.g., vectors, images, point clouds, and more). With it, Lance gives AI teams a high performance single-source of truth across the whole AI life-cycle from analytics to training to debugging.\n\nIn this talk we'll cover the use cases for production inference and in the data lake. We'll talk about the technical details of the Lance columnar format and what makes it different. And we'll show a demonstration of LanceDB for multi-modal semantic search.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
