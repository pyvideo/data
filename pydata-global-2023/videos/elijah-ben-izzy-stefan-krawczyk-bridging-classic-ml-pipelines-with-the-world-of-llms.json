  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nYou probably don\u2019t need a fancy new tool to take advantage of LLMs. While the explosion of inventive AI applications feels like a massive leap forward, the core challenges in plugging them into the business represent an incremental step from the discipline of MLOps.\n\nThe challenges are largely equivalent. Retrieval augmented generation is effectively a recommendation system. Agents are the control flow of your program. Chains of LLM calls are simple DAGs. And you\u2019re still stuck trying to monitor quantitatively unclear predictions, wrestle expensive, unstable APIs into submissions, and build out and manage complex dataflows.\n\nThe toolbox, as well, remains similar. In this talk we present the library Hamilton, an open source microframework for expressing dataflows in python. We show how it can help you build observable, stable, context-independent pipelines that span the gamut from classical ML to LLMs/RAG, enabling you to maintain sanity and keep up with the pace of change as everyone steps into the fascinating new world of AI.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
