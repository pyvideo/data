In this tutorial, we will explore how communities form in organizations to develop a better solution than \"The Org Chart\". We will walk through using a few key Python libraries in the space, develop a toolkit for Clustering Attributed Graphs (more on that later) and build out an extensible interactive dashboard application that promises to take your legacy HR reporting structure to the next level.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
