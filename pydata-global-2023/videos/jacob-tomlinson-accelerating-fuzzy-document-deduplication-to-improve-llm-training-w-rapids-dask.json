NVIDIA NeMo Data Curator is a toolkit built with RAPIDS and Dask for extracting, cleaning, filtering and deduplicating training data for LLMs.\n\nIn this session, we will zoom in on one element of LLM pretraining and explore how we can scale out fuzzy deduplication of many terabytes of documents. We can run a distributed Jaccard similarity workload by deploying a RAPIDS accelerated Dask cluster on Kubernetes to remove duplicate documents from our training set.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
