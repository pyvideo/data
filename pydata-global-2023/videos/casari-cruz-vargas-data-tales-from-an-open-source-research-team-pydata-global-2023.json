  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nHave you ever started a seemingly straight-forward project which you assumed would \"only take a little bit\", to find yourself hours later with all the tabs open, closer to the gnarliness of the truth, but still far away from a simple answer? Are you curious why you can't find the data you need, if open source is so open? We've all been there, including teams with literally decades of professional data and analysis experience. In this talk, our team from the Google Open Source Programs office will share stories and hard-learned lessons from our work researching and analyzing data to more deeply understand open source.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
