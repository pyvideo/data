More recently, cloud economics and the intense demand for running AI workloads has led to a convergence of older, established standards like MPI and a desire to run them on modern cloud frameworks like Kubernetes. In this tutorial, we will discuss the historical arc of massively parallel computation, focusing on how modern cloud frameworks like Kubernetes can both serve data scientists looking to build production-grade applications and run HPC-style jobs like MPI programs and distributed AI training. Moreover, we will show practical examples of submitting these jobs in a few lines of Python code.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
