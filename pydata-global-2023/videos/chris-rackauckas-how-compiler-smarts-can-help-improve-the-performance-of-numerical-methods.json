Finding out where the ball hits the ground? Solving an inverse problem to find the parameters to fit a model? In this talk we'll showcase how SciML's NonlinearSolve.jl is a general system for solving nonlinear equations and demonstrate its ability to efficiently handle these kinds of problems with high stability and performance. We will focus on how compilers are being integrated into the numerical stack so that many of the things that were manual before, such as defining sparsity patterns, Jacobians, and adjoints, are all automated out-of-the-box making it greatly outperform purely numerical codes like SciPy or NLsolve.jl.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
