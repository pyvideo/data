First, we will start by talking about How to Use the Hugging Face Hub, covering how to easily find the right models and datasets for your machine learning tasks. Then, we will walk through Building and Sharing ML Demos: covering how to quickly demo ML models for class presentations, portfolios, etc using the Gradio (www.gradio.dev) library.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
