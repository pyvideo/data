Whether you\u2019re building apps for delivery, mobility, or ecommerce, these three decision models can get you started: forecasting, scheduling, and routing. In this talk, we\u2019ll build, test, and deploy each model using Python and Google OR-Tools in a DecisionOps workflow. This talk is for data scientists and decision algorithm developers.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
