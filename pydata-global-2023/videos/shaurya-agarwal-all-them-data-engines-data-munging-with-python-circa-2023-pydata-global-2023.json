  "description": "Often our ecosystems limit us to one technology stack/framework/solution that we end up working on day-to-day. Maybe because the framework was chosen for us, maybe it's the one available at hand, maybe that's the skill most prevalent in the team, maybe it was chosen by following a decision analysis process, maybe other vagaries of the workplace were in play. This is incredibly limiting in developing an intuition for problem solving, exploring the possibilities and simply being able to use the right tool for the right job. In trying to gain experience on a new framework on our own, we are inundated with myriad concepts, jargon and \"technical evangelism\" so much that getting to the practical stuff often becomes an uphill battle for most of us. This workshop aims to address this fundamental issue: 1. Get hands-on experience across some of the most in-demand data engineering frameworks around today - Pandas, Spark, Dask, Polars etc. 2. Focus on the one core thing - data munging - shaping data, analyzing it and deriving insights. In this interactive 2-hour workshop, fellow data engineers will explore and gain practical experience with some of the industry's most sought-after data engineering frameworks. Through a series of engaging exercises and real-world-like examples, fellow attendees will be empowered to tackle data engineering challenges efficiently and effectively.",
