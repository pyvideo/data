In addition, operating your own LLMs can unveil advantages in aspects like data privacy, model customizability, and cost efficiency. However, running your own LLMs and realizing these benefits in a production environment is not easy - it necessitates a precise set of optimization and a robust infrastructure. Come to this talk to learn about the problems you might face when using your own large language models, and find out how OpenLLM can help you solve them.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
