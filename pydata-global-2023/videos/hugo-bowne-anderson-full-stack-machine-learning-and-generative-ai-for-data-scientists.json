In this tutorial, we present an introduction to the landscape of production-grade tools, techniques, and workflows that bridge the gap between laptop data science and production ML workflows. We\u2019ll cover a wide range of applications, including business-critical ML and data pipelines of today, as well as state-of-the-art generative AI and LLM use cases of tomorrow.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
