We will demonstrate in Python examples how data can now be moved between Pandas2, Polars, and DuckDB at no cost (zero-copy) and we will look how Arrow enables the replacement of row-oriented APIs for data retrieval (JDBC/ODBC) with column-oriented protocols (Arrow Flight and ADBC). We will show how we built a query service that bridges the data lake with Python clients. DataFrame clients can read data using a network hosted service that reads Arrow data from Parquet files, processes the data in Arrow format, and transfers the data to clients using Arrow Flight service. We will also look to a file-free future for DataFrames, where they can be easily stored and updated in a serverless platform.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
