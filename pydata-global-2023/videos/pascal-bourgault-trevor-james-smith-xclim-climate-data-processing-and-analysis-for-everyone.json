  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nClimate change projections and analyses are one of many processes that require not only sound scientific approaches, but also scalable and efficient algorithms due to the data-intensive nature of climate science.\n\nXclim is a cutting-edge climate analysis library built using xarray and dask to solve real problems in climate change analysis and processing, offering tools such as climate model ensemble selection and bias adjustment, climate data health check-ups, in addition to the ability to calculate more than 150 relevant climate indicators over enormous databases.\n\nDeveloped with user-friendliness in mind, Xclim serves as the backbone of Environment and Climate Change Canada's ClimateData.ca platform.\n\nJoin us to explore Xclim's capabilities and follow a typical workflow, transforming vast climate datasets into actionable climate insights.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
