  "description": "If you want to make your code run faster, it is important to\nunderstanding how computers (and also Python!) do work under the hood.\nBy understanding this and having knowledge of good profiler, you can\nmake your code run faster.\n\nThis talk will introduce nice tools for the job. Using ``dis`` module,\nyou can understand the workflow of Python code. Using various profiler\n(such as, ``cProfile``, ``line_profiler``, ``profiling``), you can find\nbottlenecks in your code easily.\n\nAfter that, you can write fast code.\n",
