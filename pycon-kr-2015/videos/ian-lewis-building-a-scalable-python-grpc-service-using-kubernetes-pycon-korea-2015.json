  "description": "gRPC is a new high performance, open source, general RPC framework that\nuses the HTTP/2 standard. The gRPC framework allows you to create small\nscalable services that fit well into a service oriented architecture.\nKubernetes is a cluster manager that allows you to create services that\ncan be scaled easily. Service oriented architecture is a key part of how\nmany companies, like Google, operate their infrastructure to provide\nrobust, and highly available services that operate at a consistently\nhigh level of performance for end users.\n\nIn this talk I will talk about how to use Python to create a scalable\ngRPC service and then how to actually manage and scale it using the\nKubernetes cluster manager. Using Python allows you to make use of the\nextensive set of Python libraries publicly available. Python is a\nflexible language that can be very efficient when tuned properly.\n",
