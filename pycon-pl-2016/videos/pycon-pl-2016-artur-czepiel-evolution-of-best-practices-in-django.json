  "description": "Some 'best practices' are no longer 'best'. There are newer and better\ntools available to solve problems that even a couple of months/years ago\nrequired a lot of hacking and/or ugly code. In this talk I'll show you\nsome examples of patterns and solutions that no longer apply and\ncurrent/latest best practices. Also why they are better, why you should\nupgrade your code as soon as possible, and how to deal with 'obsoledge'.\nIncludes Request/Resposne, Databases, Templates, APIs, 3rd parties, and\nmore.\n",
