  "description": "Many people believe that GIL completely rules out executing Python code\nin parallel. It's true that GIL limits it to some extent, however the\nrich ecosystem of Python modules not only allows that, but even offers\nseveral ways of how it can be achieved. During the talk I will describe\nthese approaches together with their corresponding modules. I will also\nbriefly discuss when using parallelism in Python might be beneficial,\nwhen to avoid it and what possible traps might be encountered during\nparallel execution of Python code.\n",
