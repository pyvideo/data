  "description": "Debugging is a crucial part of day-to-day activities of Python\ndevelopers. Everybody's familiar with pdb, which is our bread and\nbutter, but sometimes it can't help you, e.g. when you are trying to\ndebug a CPython extension or need to connect to a hanged process without\nrestarting it. This is where general purpose debuggers like gdb shine.\nBeing familiar with such tools allows one to troubleshoot complex issues\nefficiently and solve problems which otherwise would be very hard to\nfix.\n",
