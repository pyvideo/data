  "description": "You have created your awesome application, deployed it for the very\nfirst time, now what? How you handle application updates, what are the\npossible approaches? Do you pick your deployment strategy by your\nfavorite color, blue- green, canary, other? Yet, the decision is very\nsimple, or I should rather say switching from one strategy to other is\nas simple as never before. During this presentation I will show you\nthree different deployment strategies and how to apply those to sample\npython application.\n",
