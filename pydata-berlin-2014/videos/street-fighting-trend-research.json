How to pick\nsessions from a large conference program (think PyCon, PyData or Strata)\nthat are presenting something really novel? How to automagically\nidentify trends in industries such as computer vision or\ntelecommunications? The talk will show how to tackle common tasks in\napplied trend research and technology foresight from identifying a\ndata-source, getting the data and data cleaning to presenting the\ninsights in meaningful visualizations.\n",
