  "description": "ABBY is a Django app that helps you manage your A/B tests. The main\nobjective is to document all tests happening in your company, in order\nto better understand which measures work and which don't. Thereby\nleading to a better understanding of your product and your customer.\nABBY offers a front-end that makes it easy to edit, delete or create\ntests and to add evaluation results. Further, it provides a RESTful API\nto integrate directly with our platform to easily handle A/B tests\nwithout touching the front-end. Another notable feature is the\npossibility to upload a CSV file and have the A/B test auto-evaluated,\nalthough this feature is considered highly experimental. At Jimdo, a\ndo-it-yourself website builder, we have a team of about 180 people from\ndifferent countries and with professional backgrounds just as diverse.\nTherefore it is crucial to have tools that allow having a common\nperspective on the tests. This facilitates having data informed\ndiscussions and to deduce effective solutions. In our opinion tools like\nABBY are cornerstones to achieve the ultimate goal of being a\ndata-driven company. It enables all our co-workers to review past and\nplan future tests to further improve our product and to raise the\nhappiness of our customers. The proposed talk will give a detailed\noverview of ABBY, which eventually will be open-sourced, and its\ncapabilities. I will further discuss the motivation behind the app and\nthe influence it has on the way our company is becoming increasingly\ndata driven.\n",
