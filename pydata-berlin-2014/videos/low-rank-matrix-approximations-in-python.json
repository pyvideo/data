  "description": "Low-rank approximations of data matrices have become an important tool\nin machine learning and data mining. They allow for embedding high\ndimensional data in lower dimensional spaces and can therefore mitigate\neffects due to noise, uncover latent relations, or facilitate further\nprocessing. These properties have been proven successful in many\napplication areas such as bio-informatics, computer vision, text\nprocessing, recommender systems, social network analysis, among others.\nPresent day technologies are characterized by exponentially growing\namounts of data. Recent advances in sensor technology, internet\napplications, and communication networks call for methods that scale to\nvery large and/or growing data matrices. In this talk, we will describe\nhow to efficiently analyze data by means of matrix factorization using\nthe Python Matrix Factorization Toolbox (PyMF) and HDF5. We will briefly\ncover common methods such as k-means clustering, PCA, or Archetypal\nAnalysis which can be easily cast as a matrix decomposition, and explain\ntheir usefulness for everyday data analysis tasks.\n",
