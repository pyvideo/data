  "summary": "People talk about a Moore's Law for gene sequencing, a Moore's Law for\nsoftware, etc. This is talk is about *the* Moore's Law, the bull that\nthe other \"Laws\" ride; and how Python-powered ML helps drive it. How do\nwe keep making ever-smaller devices? How do we harness atomic-scale\nphysics? Large-scale machine learning is key. The computation drives new\nchip designs, and those new chip designs are used for new computations,\nad infinitum. High-dimensional regression, classification, active\nlearning, optimization, ranking, clustering, density estimation,\nscientific visualization, massively parallel processing -- it all comes\ninto play, and Python is powering it all.\n",
