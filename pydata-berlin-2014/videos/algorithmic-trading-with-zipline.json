  "description": "PyData Berlin 2014 - Python is quickly becoming the glue language which\nholds together data science and related fields like quantitative\nfinance. Zipline is a BSD-licensed quantitative trading system which\nallows easy backtesting of investment algorithms on historical data. The\nsystem is fundamentally event-driven and a close approximation of how\nlive-trading systems operate. Moreover, Zipline comes \"batteries\nincluded\" as many common statistics like moving average and linear\nregression can be readily accessed from within a user-written algorithm.\nInput of historical data and output of performance statistics is based\non Pandas DataFrames to integrate nicely into the existing Python\neco-system. Furthermore, statistic and machine learning libraries like\nmatplotlib, scipy, statsmodels, and sklearn integrate nicely to support\ndevelopment, analysis and visualization of state-of-the-art trading\nsystems. Zipline is currently used in production as the backtesting\nengine powering Quantopian.com -- a free, community-centered platform\nthat allows development and real-time backtesting of trading algorithms\nin the web browser.\n",
