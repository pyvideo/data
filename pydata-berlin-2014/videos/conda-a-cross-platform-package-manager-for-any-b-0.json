  "description": "Conda is an open source package manager, which can be used to manage\nbinary packages and virtual environments on any platform. It is the\npackage manager of the Anaconda Python distribution, although it can be\nused independently of Anaconda. We will look at how conda solves many of\nthe problems that have plagued Python packaging in the past, followed by\na demonstration of its features. We will look at the issues that have\nplagued packaging in the Python ecosystem in the past, and discuss how\nConda solves these problems. We will show how to use conda to manage\nmultiple environments. Finally, we will look at how to build your own\nconda packages.\n",
