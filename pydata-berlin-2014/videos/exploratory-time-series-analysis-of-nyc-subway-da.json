  "description": "What questions arise during a quick model assessment? In this\nhands-on-tutorial we want to cover the whole chain from preparing data\nto choosing and fitting a model to properly assessing the quality of a\npredictive model. Our dataset in this tutorial are the numbers of people\nentering and exiting New York subway stations. Among other ways of\nbuilding a predictive model, we introduce the python package pydse (\nhttp://pydse.readthedocs.org/ ) and apply it to the dataset in order to\nderive the parameters of an ARMA-model (autoregressive moving average).\nAt the end of the tutorial we evaluate the models and examine the\nstrengths and weaknesses of various ways to measure the accuracy and\nquality of a predictive model.\n",
