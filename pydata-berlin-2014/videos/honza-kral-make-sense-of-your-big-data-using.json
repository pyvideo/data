  "summary": "In this talk I would like to show you a few real-life use-cases where\nElasticsearch can help you make sense of your data. We will start with\nthe most basic use case of searching your unstructured data and move on\nto more advanced topics such as faceting, aggregations and structured\nsearch. I would like to demonstrate that the very same tool and dataset\ncan be used for real-time analytics as well as the basis for your more\nadvanced data processing jobs. All in a distributed environment capable\nof handling terabyte-sized datasets. All examples will be shown with\nreal data and python code demoing the new libraries we have been working\non to make this process easier.\n",
