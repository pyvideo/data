  "description": "Talk \nData scientists have likely heard that machine learning models are \u2018black boxes\u2019 and not interpretable. This notion, once formerly true, is no longer correct. In this talk, the modelers at Southeast Toyota Finance will focus on model-agnostic interpretability techniques. We\u2019ll provide an end-to-end example of the experimentation process of modeling combined with interpretability techniques.\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. 00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
