  "description": "Talk \nGiven a student\u2019s grades, what would be a good score in their exam? An econometrician could model the conditional quantiles directly. We\u2019ll show their linear models and how you can implement neural net versions in tensorflow or use xgboost. Even if you never end up fitting a quantile regression, you\u2019ll learn a new metric for evaluating how well you are estimating extreme examples!\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. 00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
