  "description": "Talk \nAt The National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado we distribute a trove of remote sensing data that is used globally to conduct important scientific research. We\u2019ll explore in an interactive way some of these data sets scientists use to assess and forecast climate change.\n\nSpeaker \nI\u2019m a Software Engineer at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. NSIDC is one of 9 data centers for NASA\u2019s Earth Data systems. I\u2019m currently working on building services on top of remote sensing data and trying to close the gap between cryospheric research and understandable, reproducible science.\n\nI\u2019m from Mexico and attended grad school at the University of Colorado.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. 00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
