  "description": "Talk \nThis is the story of how we built the Octopod library. Octopod streamlines the training of multi-task PyTorch networks. It supports training with multiple task-specific datasets, multiple inputs, and ensembles of multi-task networks. We will discuss technical details of the library as well as interpersonal challenges we faced along the way.\n\nSpeakers\nNicole is a Data Science Manager at ShopRunner. She\u2019s passionate about diverse and inclusive teams.\n\nMichael is a Senior Data Scientist at ShopRunner. He is a data scientist, gamer, martial artist, photographer, and chef\u2026 also part time house cat. \n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. 00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
