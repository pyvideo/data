  "description": "Talk\nCreating and growing an elite data science team is no small feat. In this talk, we will discuss the three key areas to focus on when setting up your data science organization: building the right team, selecting the right use cases, and rapid technical enablement. While the path forward may seem daunting, this flexible yet focused approach will position you for success.\n\nSpeaker \nAs a trusted leader and practitioner in Data Science and AI, Justin partners with clients to deliver robust data-driven solutions that increase revenue, reduce costs, and lead to greater operational efficiencies. Justin has completed undergraduate and graduate studies in engineering and computer science at Georgia Tech and Stanford University, and he has more than eight years of experience supporting clients in industries including energy, hospitality, and software development. He has built and commercialized AI products using NLP as well as guided large enterprises through their AI journey and transformation.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. 00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
