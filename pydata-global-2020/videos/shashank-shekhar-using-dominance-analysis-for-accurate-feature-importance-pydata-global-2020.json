  "description": "Talk \nI will demonstrate the usage of Azen and Budescu\u2019s Dominance Analysis (leveraging the Python library developed by us) to accurately determine the relative importance of features in scenarios where there is need to marginally allocate resources to enable an outcome.\n\nSpeaker\nShashank is Data Sciences leader with diverse experience across verticals including CPG, Retail, Hitech and E-commerce domains. He is currently heading the Aritficial Intelligence Labs at Subex. In the past, he has worked in VMware, Amazon, Flipkart and Target and has been involved in solving various complex business problems using Machine Learning and Deep Learning. He has been part of the program committee of several international conferences like ICDM and MLDM and was selected as a mentor in Global Datathon 2018 organized by Data Sciences Society. He has multiple publications in the field of data sciences, machine learning, deep learning and image recognition in several international journals of repute to his credit. He has spoken at many summits and conferences like Big Data Lake Summit, PlugIn etc. He has also published two open source libraries on Python and is an active contributor to the global Python community.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. 00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
