This solution comes from a famous statistics problem, Multi-Armed Bandits.\n\nSpeaker \nHagit Grushka-Cohen is a PhD student at Ben-Gurion University, the department of software and information systems, under the supervision of prof. Lior Rokach and prof. Bracha Shapira. Her PhD topic at applied Machine Learning in the domain of cyber security. Hagit won the prestigious IBM fellowship award for her work on risk assessment and working towards automatic policy calibration twice. During her PhD Hagit collaborated with IBM Guardium and IBM, IBM Cyber Center of Excellence which led to several ML papers (including CIKM and PAKDD). Prior to starting her PhD Hagit was a project manager in Adama and a BI projects leader in Stanly works.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. 00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
