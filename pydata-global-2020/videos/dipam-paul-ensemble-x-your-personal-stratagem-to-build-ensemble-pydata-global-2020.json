  "description": "Talk \nIn this talk, we will deep dive into the world of Medical Imaging and Radiology, in particular. We will soar through the mighty oceans of various kinds of diseases and limitations of AI with the prevalent Deep Learning architectures which are at our disposal. At this point, we will also delve into the progress that has been made in the domain of integrative healthcare.\n\nSpeakers\nCommonly referred to as \u2018The Boy from Kolkata\u2019 - Dipam is a final-year student pursuing Electronics and Telecommunication from KIIT University, India. He has previously presented at three PyCons-\n\n(1) PyCon USA 2019 (Cleveland, Ohio) [Speaker Profile]\n\n(2) PyCon India 2019 (Chennai, India) [Speaker Profile]\n\n(3) PyCon USA 2020 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) [Speaker Profile]\n\n(4) PyCon Australia 2020 (Adelaide, Australia) [Speaker Profile]\n\nCurrently, he is an incoming Research Assistant at Stanford Medicine and will be working on areas of Radiology and Pain operating from the city of California.\n\nHe has previously worked in labs at Georgia Institute of Technology, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo and IIT Bombay in various roles and capacities.\n\nHaving always been fascinated by the wonders one can do using Python, his periphery of interest lies in Biomedical-Imaging and NLP. He spends his days toying around with Machine-Learning models and fine-tuning Neural Nets when he is not eating, raconteuring or engaging in a lively debate about Geopolitics or Football!\n\nHailing from a small town called Lucknow, in India, Alankrita is a final year student at KIIT University. She started exploring Python recently and have been smitten by it ever since. She believes that the sky is the limit when it comes to what can be done with Python.\n\nSince then, she has presented her research in conferences like - PyCon US 2020 PyCon Australia 2020 IEEE 33rd International Symposium on Computer Based Medical Systems (CBMS) And she hopes to continue doing so.\n\nIn her spare time she is found reading, dreaming about seemingly impossible sci-fi scenarios (like the time she thought of using magnetic boots to levitate) and petting every dog she sees.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. 00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
