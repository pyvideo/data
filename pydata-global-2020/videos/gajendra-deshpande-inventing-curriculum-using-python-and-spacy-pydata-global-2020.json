  "description": "Talk \nIn this talk, attendees will learn about natural language processing techniques (spaCy) using Python and how it can be combined with machine learning(scikit-learn) to generate new knowledge from the existing knowledge. We will talk about how we designed curriculum using natural language processing, unsupervised machine learning and pointer-generator network.\n\n\nSpeaker\nI have delivered talks at SciPy India, PyCon FR, PyCon HK and JuliaCon. I use Python extensively for teaching and research. My major work includes using Python to develop prototypes in the field of Cyber Security. I lead PyData Belagavi and OWASP Belagavi chapters. I love to mentor students and volunteer at Free and Open Source events.\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. 00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
