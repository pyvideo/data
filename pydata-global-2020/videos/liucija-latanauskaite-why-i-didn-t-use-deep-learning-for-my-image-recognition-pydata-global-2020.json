  "description": "Talk \nThis is a how-things-went-wrong story of using deep learning to match images of climbing holds in gyms. But there\u2019s a happy ending: a more traditional computer vision solution outperforms neural nets.\nSpeaker \nI am data scientist coming from a statistical background, always on the lookout for problems to solve using data.\n\nBy day, I work at GoCardless, a recurring payments provider, where I create machine learning products to reduce payment failure rates and tackle fraud.\n\nMy second life is rock climbing and working on Climbicus - an app for logging climbing routes at an indoor gym, leveraging computer vision techniques.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. 00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
