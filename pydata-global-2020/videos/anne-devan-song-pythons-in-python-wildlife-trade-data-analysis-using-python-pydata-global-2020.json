  "description": "Talk \nI am a data scientist and field biologist with research interests in social ecological systems. I am a PhD candidate at Oregon State University, co-advised in disease ecology and social-environmental analysis labs. For my PhD, I am using network analytic tools to understand properties of wildlife and human-wildlife collectives, through a lens of disease spread and conservation. I am particularly interested in the integration of field biology methods with computational approaches to solve real-world conservation problems.\n\nI am originally from Singapore, and now live in Corvallis, Oregon, USA, where I love cycling, hiking, climbing, and cooking. You can read more about me on my website.\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. 00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
