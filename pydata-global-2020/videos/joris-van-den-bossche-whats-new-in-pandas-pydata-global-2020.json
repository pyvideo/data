This talk will give an overview of what\u2019s happening in the latest releases of pandas and where we are heading to, and highlight some important milestones for the project achieved over the last year.\n\nSpeakers\nJoris is a core contributor to Pandas and Apache Arrow and maintainer of GeoPandas. I did a PhD at Ghent University and VITO in air quality research, worked at the Paris-Saclay Center for Data Science, and currently, I am a freelance software developer and teacher and working for Ursa Labs.\n\nTom is a software engineer at Anaconda where he works on open-source libraries like pandas and Dask.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. 00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
