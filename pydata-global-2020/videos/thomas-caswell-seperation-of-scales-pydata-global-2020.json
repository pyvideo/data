  "description": "Talk \nAs programmers we work in deeply layered systems. When a layer below us \u201cjust works\u201d things feel easy and life is great! However, all to often it feels like our tools fight back and get in the way. In this talk, we will discuss how to identify the good scales and abstractions in software, and how to build pleasant tools for ourselves and others.\n\nSpeaker\nThomas is a soft-matter physicist who now developer software for scientists. He develops data acquisition, management, and analysis tools at NSLS-II at BNL, as a core maintainer of h5py, and is the current Project Lead of Matplotlib.\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. 00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
