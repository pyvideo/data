  "description": "Talk \nUnderstanding in what situations an ML model fails is essential to attempt to fix the model\u2019s flaws. For data scientists concerned with robust ML system design, this talk will show how to streamline error analysis thanks to Model Performance Predictors, by automatically breaking down model failures into meaningful clusters and comparing them with the successfully predicted baseline.\n\nSpeaker \nAfter obtaining a PhD in Biomedical Image Processing in 2011, Simona Maggio worked in several companies (CEA, Thales, Rakuten) as a Research Engineer in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing for applications ranging from video surveillance to document digitization and e-commerce. She\u2019s now Senior Research Scientist at Dataiku, exploring MLOps topics, such as model debugging, robustness and interpretability.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. 00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
