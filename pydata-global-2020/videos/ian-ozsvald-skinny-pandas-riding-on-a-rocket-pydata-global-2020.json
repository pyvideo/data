  "description": "Talk \nWith larger datasets we need to be smarter about how we use Pandas to get results. We\u2019ll look at strategies to shrink our data to get more into RAM, offload computation to tools like Dask or Vaex, store with Parquet or SQLite, make calculations faster and retain debuggability.\n\nSpeaker \nIan is a Chief Data Scientist and Coach, he helps co-organise the annual PyDataLondon conference with 700+ attendees and the associated 11,000+ member monthly meetup. He runs the established Mor Consulting Data Science consultancy in London, gives conference talks internationally often as keynote speaker and is the author of the bestselling O\u2019Reilly book High Performance Python (2nd edition). He has 18 years of experience as a senior data science leader, trainer and team coach. For fun he\u2019s walked by his high-energy Springer Spaniel, surfs the Cornish coast and drinks fine coffee.

PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. 00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
