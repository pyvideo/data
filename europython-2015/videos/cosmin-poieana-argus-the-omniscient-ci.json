  "description": "Cosmin Poieana - Argus - the omniscient CI\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[21 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nBring the continuous integration to a new level, through a\nplatform/project independent framework able to give you unittest-like\nreports. Argus is a scenario-based application written in Python,\ndriven by custom recipes under configurable environments, that can be\nused for testing a wide variety of small and big projects, with the\nability of querying live data from the in-test application.\n\nUntil now, it's successfully used with [cloudbase-init][1] (a robust\ncloud initialization service for instances) under OpenStack and not\nonly, due to its extensiveness and the ability to mimic different\ninfrastructures. More details can be found on the package page:\nhttps://github.com/PCManticore/argus-ci.\n\nThe goals of this talk are to show its generic scalability, how simple\nis to create such kind of recipes, the relationship between scenarios,\nintrospection and tests and, but not last, the unlimited freedom of\ncreating very custom aspects of these entities which lead to relevant\nand in-depth ready for analysis logs. There are no major prerequisites\nto understand it, just to be familiar with Python and optionally have\na focus on cloud infrastructures.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/stackforge/cloudbase-init",
