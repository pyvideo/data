It offers tools all across the complexity\nspectrum that library authors can use to make their libraries seem\nconvenient to use for users.\n\nWhile it's true that there are a wealth of techniques with huge\npositive benefits, there are a number of common antipatterns which can\ndeceptively cause a net-loss in flexibility, readability, and\npredictability for users.\n\nWe'll explore a few specific commonalities in this area of library and\nobject API design, and talk about the ramifications they have on each\nof these programmer concerns.",
