  "description": "Antonio Cuni - Python and PyPy performance (not) for dummies\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[21 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nIn this talk we would like to have a short introduction on how Python\nprograms are compiled and executed, with a special attention towards\njust in time compilation done by PyPy. PyPy is the most advanced Python\ninterpreter around and while it should generally just speed up your programs\nthere is a wide range of performance that you can get out of PyPy, ranging from\nslightly faster than CPython to C speeds, depending on how you write your\nprograms.\n\nWe will split the talk in two parts. In the first part we will explain\nhow things work and what can and what cannot be optimized as well as describe\nthe basic heuristics of JIT compiler and optimizer. In the next part we will\ndo a survey of existing tools for looking at performance of Python programs\nwith specific focus on PyPy.\n\nAs a result of this talk, an audience member should be better equipped with\ntools how to write new software and improve existing software with performance\nin mind.\n\nThe talk will be given by Antonio Cuni and Maciej Fijalkowski,\nboth long time PyPy core developers and expert in the area of\nPython performance.",
