  "description": "Lynn Root - Diversity: We are not done yet\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[23 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n[Education Summit]\n\nThe past few years, we have made large strides to welcome more diverse\npeople into our community.  You see better gender ratios in attendance\nnumbers at Python conferences, the billed speakers, the amount of\nwomen-centric programs.  We can see the benefits of outreach.  But\nwe're not done yet.\n\nWhile a lot of the Python community embraces the importance of being\ndiverse, we haven't taken that mindset to our workplace.  From\nrecruiting, we still hear, \"sure, we wanted to recruit women, but we\ncouldn't find them\" and \"we only focus on quality here, not gender!\"\nWithin company cultures, we hear \"gender equality isn't a problem\nhere!\" or \"women don't ask for a higher salary\" and to \"just lean in!\"\n\nThis talk will recount the diversity efforts of the past few years and\nquantify the effects on the Python community.  But this talk will also\naddress the not-so-low-hanging fruit; the  deeper-rooted problems that\nstill plague the community from inside where we work.  And it will\ntalk the audience through actionable items to improve one's work place\nthat welcomes more diversity.",
