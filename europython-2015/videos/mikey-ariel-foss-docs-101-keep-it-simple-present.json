Do you wish\nthat new users could get started with your software more easily? Do\nyou feel that your code contribution workflow isn't documented well\nenough, or that contributors are discouraged from documenting their\ncode? How can you give your project docs the love they deserve?\n\nThis high-level talk aims to introduce the main principles of\ntechnical communication in the context of FOSS projects. It is\nintended for anyone who interacts with docs, whether your project is\nfresh off the dev environment or has been around since the dawn of\nGit. Topics include tone, style, process management, structure, and\ncontribution workflow.",
