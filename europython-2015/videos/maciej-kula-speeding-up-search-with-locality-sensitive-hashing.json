  "description": "Maciej Kula - Speeding up search with locality sensitive hashing\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[24 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nLocality sensitive hashing (LSH) is a technique for reducing complex\ndata down to a simple hash code. If two hash codes are similar than\nthe original data is similar. Typically, they are used for speeding up\nsearch and other similarity comparisons.\n\nIn this presentation I will discuss two ways of implementing LSH in\npython; the first method is completely stateless but only works on\ncertain forms of data; the second is stateful but does not make any\nassumptions about the distribution of the underlying data. I will\nconclude the presentation by describing how we apply LSH to search at\nLyst.",
