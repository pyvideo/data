  "description": "Harry Percival - PythonAnywhere and Education\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[23 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n[Education Summit]\n\nPython may be the ideal language for teaching because of its\nsimplicity and readability, but actually getting a working and\nconsistent development environment installed on a diverse set of\nstudent (or school) computers can be less than straightforward. And\nthen there's pip, numpy, scipy, windows vs unix command lines...\n\nAs a result, we've had lots of teachers coming to PythonAnywhere over\nthe years, to skip all these problems. We've recently started adding\nsome extra features to help teachers and students which we're keen to\nshare with the EuroPython audience.",
