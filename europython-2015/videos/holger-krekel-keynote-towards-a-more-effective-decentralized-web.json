  "description": "Holger Krekel - Keynote: Towards a more effective, decentralized web\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[22 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nMany would like to see more decentralization but what does it mean,\nreally?  In this talk, I'll discuss the recent rise of immutable state\nconcepts in languages and network protocols.  And how the advent of\nhash-based data structures and replication strategies are shaking the\nclient/server web service paradigm which rests on managing mutable\nstate through http.  By contrast, building on git, bittorrent and\nother content addressed data structures provides for a more secure,\nefficient decentralized communication topology.   There are projects,\nthoughts and talk to create new web standards to bring such\ntechnologies to mass deployment and fuel a new wave of\ndecentralization.  What can Python bring to the table?",
