  "description": "Ramon Navarro Bosch - Plone 5 and how to use machine learning with it.\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[22 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nPlone is a Document Management System and Content Management System\nthat has been in the Python scope for more than 10 years.\n\nPlone 5\u2019s features allow us to manage content, define various kinds of\ncontent and provide a nice useful UI to work on semantic web\ntechnologies. In this talk we are going to explain our approach for\nusing Plone with the Python machine learning toolkit sklearn (http\n://scikit-learn.org/stable/) to enable clusterization and\nclassification of content using a scalable content management system.\nWe will also add some sophisticated front-end gloss using the new\nfunctionalities on frontend development added on Plone 5 and some real\nuse cases of CMS/DMS with machine learning using sklean and solr.",
