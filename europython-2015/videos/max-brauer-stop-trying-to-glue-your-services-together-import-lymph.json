  "description": "Max Brauer - Stop trying to glue your services together; import lymph\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[21 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nWhat if you could focus on functionality rather than the glue code\nbetween services?\n\nLymph is an opinionated framework for writing services in Python.  It\nfeatures pluggable service discovery, request-reply messaging and\npluggable pub-sub messaging.\n\nAs our development teams are growing, we're moving away from our\nmonolithic architecture. We want to write services and not worry about\nthe infrastructure's needs. We want development to be fast, quick and\nsimply work.\n\nIn this talk we will show you how easy it is to write and run services\nwith lymph.\nGo check http://lymph.io - we are accepting pull requests.\n\nhttp://import-lymph.link/",
