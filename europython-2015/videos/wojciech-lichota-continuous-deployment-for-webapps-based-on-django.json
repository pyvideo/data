  "description": "Wojciech Lichota - Continuous Deployment for webapps based on Django\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[24 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nWhen you see users starting to use your feature, you feel very proud\nand fulfilled. So why feel this only once every few weeks, why not\nfeel it every day? In this talk I will show how we changed our\nworkflow to automate deployment of code changes to production every\ntime a feature is ready - sometimes even few times per day. I will\npresent how to successfully combine open-source tools like Git,\nJenkins, Buildout, Fabric, uWSGI, and South, in order to simplify the\nprocess and make it more reliable. I will discuss challenges that we\nfaced implementing this workflow in a real project based on Django and\nhow we resolved them. During this talk you will gain the knowledge\nrequired to implement Continuous Deployment in your own project.",
