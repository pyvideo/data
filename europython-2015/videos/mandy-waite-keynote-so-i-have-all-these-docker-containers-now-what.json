  "description": "Mandy Waite - Keynote: So, I have all these Docker containers, now what?\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[24 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nYou've solved the issue of process-level reproducibility by packaging up\nyour apps and execution environments into a number of Docker containers.\nBut once you have a lot of containers running, you'll probably need to\ncoordinate them across a cluster of machines while keeping them healthy and\nmaking sure they can find each other. Trying to do this imperatively can\nquickly turn into an unmanageable mess! Wouldn't it be helpful if you could\ndeclare to your cluster what you want it to do, and then have the cluster\nassign the resources to get it done and to recover from failures and scale\non demand?\n\nKubernetes (http://kubernetes.io) is an open source, cross platform cluster\nmanagement and container orchestration platform that simplifies the complex\ntasks of deploying and managing your applications in Docker containers. You\ndeclare a desired state, and Kubernetes does all the work needed to create\nand maintain it. In this talk, we\u2019ll look at the basics of Kubernetes and\nat how to map common applications to these concepts. This will include a\nhands-on demonstration and visualization of the steps involved in getting\nan application up and running on Kubernetes.",
