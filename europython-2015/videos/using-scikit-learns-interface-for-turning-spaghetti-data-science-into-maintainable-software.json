  "description": "Holger Peters - Using Scikit-Learn's interface for turning Spaghetti Data Science into Maintainable Software\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[21 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nFinding a good structure for number-crunching code can be a problem,\nthis especially applies to routines preceding the core algorithms:\ntransformations such as data processing and cleanup, as well as\nfeature construction.\n\nWith such code, the programmer faces the problem, that their code\neasily  turns into a sequence of highly interdependent operations,\nwhich are hard to separate. It can be challenging to test, maintain\nand reuse such \"Data Science Spaghetti code\".\n\nScikit-Learn offers a simple yet powerful interface for data science\nalgorithms: the estimator and composite classes (called meta-\nestimators). By example, I show how clever usage of meta-estimators\ncan encapsulate elaborate machine learning models into a maintainable\ntree of objects that is both handy to use and simple to test.\n\nLooking at examples, I will show how this approach simplifies model\ndevelopment, testing and validation and how this brings together best\npractices from software engineering as well as data science.\n\n_Knowledge of Scikit-Learn is handy but not necessary to follow this talk._",
