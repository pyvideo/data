  "description": "Alexys Jacob - Designing a scalable and distributed application\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[22 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nOne of the key aspect to keep in mind when developing a scalable\napplication is its faculty to grow easily. But while we're used to\ntake advantage of scalable backend technologies such as mongodb or\ncouchbase, **scaling automatically our own application** core is\nusually another story.\n\nIn this talk I will **explain and showcase** a distributed web\napplication design based on **consul** and **uWSGI** and its consul\nplugin. This design will cover the key components of a distributed and\nscalable application:\n\n- **Automatic service registration and discovery** will allow your application to grow itself automatically.\n-  **Health checking and service unregistration** will allow your application to be fault tolerant, highly available and to shrink itself automatically.\n- A **distributed Key/Value storage** will allow you to (re)configure your distributed application nodes at once.\n- **Multi-Datacenter awareness** will allow your application to scale around the world easily.\n\n`Slides of this talk are available here <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bZ30UculKOM4IQ4ic5X2fLpz1Fe1QQPVqJLtshIO0pg/edit?usp=sharing>`_",
