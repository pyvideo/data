  "description": "Juan Manuel Santos - Salting things up in the sysadmin's world\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[21 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nSaltStack is a thriving configuration management system written in\nPython that leverages YAML and Jinja2 which, by now, probably needs no\nintroduction.\n\nThis talk will cover a brief summary of why we need configuration\nmanagement tools, followed by a full dive into SaltStack, its\nfeatures, pros and cons, how to use it and how to extend it. By the\nend of this talk you will have gone from knowing little or nothing\nabout SaltStack, to being able to deploy your own setup.\n\nThis talk will be targeted to either seasoned Python developers who\nare taking their first steps in the system administration world, or\nestablished system administrators who secretly love Python and prefer\nto stay away of configuration management systems based on other\nlanguages.\nIts advisable that attendees have some familiarity with Python as well\nas with system administration concepts. Also, this presentation will\nbe focused on GNU/Linux systems, so it is expected that attendees are\ncomfortable with some of its concepts.",
