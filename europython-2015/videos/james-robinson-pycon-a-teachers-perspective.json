  "description": "James Robinson - Pycon - A teacher's perspective\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[23 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n[Education Summit]\n\nA perspective of the impact of the PyconUK education track from the\npoint of view of teachers and educators.\n\nHaving attended the education track at Pycon UK 2014 as a teacher, my\ntalk will share both my experiences and those of other teachers\nattending. The  education track bought educators and developers\ntogether in a way that allowed the teachers to get support and advice\nwhilst developers   get to support teachers in developing exciting &\nreal applications for teaching computing.\n\nThe talk will focus on two aspects of the education track. The\nworkshops delivered for teachers by python developers and how this\nhelps build teachers confidence.  But also the breakout sessions where\neducators and developers with common interests can work together to\ndevelop something. This might be a program / library or a teaching\nresource, some developers gave a hands on and bespoke training session\nto a group of teachers.\n\nIf we are to get more young people programming or at least having  a\npositive experience of programming then we need to minimize obstacles\nto that experience. By having educators and developers working\ntogether we can identify those obstacles and eliminate them!\n\nhttps://goo.gl/nt05hC",
