  "description": "Rados\u0142aw Jankiewicz - Writing quality code\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[20 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nThe quality of written code is an important factor in a final success\nof a software project.\nPerhaps there is no universal definition of high quality code, however\nusually it's characterized as clear and readable, well-designed, well\ntested and documented, easier to debug, maintain and extend, etc.\n\nPython was designed to be a highly readable language that would make\nit easier to develop high quality code. Nevertheless, programming\nlanguage is only a tool in a software development process and in the\nend the quality of code depends mostly on its author's concept and\ndecisions he make.\n\nIn this talk I would like to present some of ideas, techniques and\ntools for improving the quality of written code, tried out with a good\nresult in everyday work on developing software in Python.",
