Zalando---\nEurope\u2019s leading online fashion platform for men, women and children--\nbegan shifting from SVN to Git in late 2013. Santos and his colleagues\nused Python to create a Git update hook that enabled the team to\nreject changes to a branch while still allowing changes to other\nbranches. He\u2019ll explain why his team chose Python for this job instead\nof a bash script, point out mistakes made during the process (and\nsolutions his team used to fix them), and the benefits generated by\nthis migration. He\u2019ll also talk about turnstile: a set of open-source,\nconfigurable, optional local Git hooks, created by the Zalando team,\nthat enables engineers to abide by internal rules for committing code\nwhile following their own coding style and workflow preferences.",
