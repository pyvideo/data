  "description": "Christine Doig - Scale your data, not your process: Welcome to the Blaze ecosystem\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[21 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nNumPy and Pandas have revolutionized data processing and munging in\nthe Python ecosystem. As data and systems grow more complex, moving\nand querying becomes more difficult. Python already has excellent\ntools for in-memory datasets, but we inevitably want to scale this\nprocessing and take advantage of additional hardware. This is where\nBlaze comes in handy by providing a uniform interface to a variety of\ntechnologies and abstractions for migrating and analyzing data.\nSupported backends include databases like Postgres or MongoDB, disk\nstorage systems like PyTables, BColz, and HDF5, or distributed systems\nlike Hadoop and Spark.\n\nThis talk will introduce the Blaze ecosystem, which includes:\n\n- Blaze (data querying): [http://blaze.pydata.org/en/latest/][1]\n\n- Odo (data migration): [http://odo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/][2]\n\n- Dask (task scheduler): [http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/][3]\n\n- DyND (dynamic, multidimensional arrays): [https://github.com/libdynd/dynd-python][4]\n\n- Datashape (data description): [http://datashape.pydata.org/][5]\n\nAttendees will get the most out of this talk if they are familiar with\nNumPy and Pandas, have intermediate Python programming skills, and/or\nexperience with large datasets.\n\n[1]: http://blaze.pydata.org/en/latest/   \n\n[2]: http://odo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/  \n\n[3]: http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/  \n\n[4]: https://github.com/libdynd/dynd-python  \n\n[5]: http://datashape.pydata.org/  \n",
