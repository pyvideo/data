  "description": "Andrey Syschikov - Practical usage of advanced Python constructs\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[24 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nPython is a language of choice for developers with wide range of\nexperience, for some it is a first programming language, others switch\nto Python after years of experience. Python provides friendly syntax\nand smooth learning curve. This sometimes leads to developers lacking\ncomprehension of some more advanced constructs.\n\nIt happens that experienced developers jump into using Python and\nsometimes miss less known Python language constructs. On the other\nhands people who purposefully learned Python sometimes lack practical\nideas for how to apply those constructs.\n\nThis talk will be specifically focused on the practical usages of\nadvanced Python constructs like iterators, generators, decorators and\ncontext managers. Goal of the talk is to share ideas about how those\nconstructs can be used for practical purposes in real projects. Prior\nknowledge is not required, there will be a brief introduction to every\nconstruct being presented.",
