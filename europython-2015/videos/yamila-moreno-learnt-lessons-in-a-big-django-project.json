  "description": "Yamila Moreno - Learnt lessons in a big Django Project\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[24 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nA Django project, developed for 2 years is a valuable source of\nanecdotes and wisdom. This talk is a review on the decissions, about\nhuman and tech, that my team took during the project. I'll point out\nthe good decissions as well as the bad ones, those which made us learn\n\"the hard way\".\n\nBoth good and bad decissions taught us a lot, and here I compile them,\ntogether with a handful of tips which can amuse and, hopefully,\ninspire the audience, specially those who are facing for the first\ntime a big project.",
