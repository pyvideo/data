  "summary": "This talk is about web scraping in Python, why web scraping is useful\nand what Python libraries are available to help you. I will also look\ninto proprietary alternatives and will discuss how they work and why\nthey are not useful. I will show you different libraries used in web\nscraping and some example code so that you can choose your own personal\nfavourite. I will also tell why writing your own scrapper in scrapy\nallows you to have more control over the scraping process.\n",
