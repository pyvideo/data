  "description": "Genetic Algorithm from Scratch in Python - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nThe Genetic Algorithm is an evolutionary algorithm inspired by Charles\nDarwin\u2019s theory of natural selection. It may be one of the most popular\nbiologically inspired algorithms. In this talk, you will discover how a\ngenetic optimization algorithm works and how to implement it from\nscratch in Python. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a stochastic global search\noptimization algorithm inspired by the biological theory of evolution.\nIt is commonly used to find solutions to search and optimization\nproblems.\n\nIn this talk I will explain how GAs work going through a Python example\nimplemented from scratch. I will show how the genetic algorithm,\nstarting from a population of candidate solutions repeatedly evolves\nthem toward better solutions trying to solve an optimization problem. I\nwill illustrate a Python implementation of the main biologically\ninspired operators of GAs such as selection, crossover and mutation.\nFinally, I will mention limitations and variants of genetic algorithms.\n\nAfter the talk, you will be able to implement your own genetic algorithm\nand apply it to solve a large variety of optimization problems,\nespecially those that are not well suited for standard optimization\ntechniques, like problems in which the objective function is\nnon-differentiable or highly non-linear.\n\nSpeaker: Davide Anghileri\n",
