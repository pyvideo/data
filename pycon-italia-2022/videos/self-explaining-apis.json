  "description": "Self-explaining APIs - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nTo mash up various APIs you need data to have a well defined meaning:\nimagine meshing up healthcare APIs using different units for human\ntemperature, or financial APIs using different currencies.\n\nThis talk describes strategies and python tools to overcome these\nproblems in large API ecosystems. This talk will present strategies and\npython tools to create semantically interoperable REST APIs. After the\nproblem statement, various solutions will be presented, including: -\ncontract-first api development with OpenAPI 3, ontologies, controlled\nvocabularies; - the rdflib and pyld python libraries; - the use of\ncentralized catalogs.\n\n[Very draft slides here](\n\nSpeaker: Roberto Polli\n",
