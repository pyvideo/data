  "description": "Writing async microservices in Python - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nWriting an async microservice is a good way to improve the concurrency\nof your platform and decouple the different components of a web\nplatform, Python provides excellent tools to write them and we\u2019re going\nto introduce some of them for you to immediately start creating your\nown. While not exactly new, async programming has arrived quite recently\nin the Python core. This enabled to create a wide ecosystem of\nasync-first or async-enabled libraries and frameworks that makes async\nprogramming more available to the everyday developer. Writing an async\nmicroservice is a good way to get your hands dirty with async\nprogramming: we are going to see how to build it using FastAPI and its\necosystem to show tecniques and pitfalls.\n\nSlides:\n\nSpeaker: Iacopo Spalletti\n",
