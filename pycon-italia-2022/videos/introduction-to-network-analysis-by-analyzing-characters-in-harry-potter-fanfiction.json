  "description": "Introduction to Network Analysis by Analyzing Characters in Harry Potter\nFanfiction - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nIs Ginny considered the best girl for Harry? Do Hermione and Snape\nreally go well together? In this talk, I will go through the process of\nanalyzing the tags data from the fanfiction website, which might help\nanswer these and some similar questions. In the more and more globalized\nworld, network analysis is becoming more and more prominent in helping\nus realize how different people and things are connected. Let it be how\nthe power grid will need to change, to accommodate the move to renewable\nsources or how the different political and corporate actors are\nconnected, explaining why some changes can happen as some do not.\n\nOr it can be done to answer some other, in some way just as interesting.\nIs Ginny considered the best girl for Harry? Do Hermione and Snape\nreally go well together? And many more.\n\nIn this talk, I will go through the process of analyzing the tags data\nfrom the fanfiction website. I will go through the formatting of the\ndata for analysis with the networkx library, some simple analysis and\nthe visualization of the data.\n\nI will not assume any network analysis knowledge, but I will assume that\nyou are comfortable programming in Python on a level, that if you need\nto create a quick script, you could do it easily.\n\nSlides:\n\nSpeaker: Sara Jak\u0161a\n",
