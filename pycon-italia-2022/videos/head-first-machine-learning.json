  "description": "Head First Machine Learning - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nEvery wanted to learn Machine Learning, or at least understand the\nbasics, but you don\u2019t know where to start? Math scares you? Bad\nexperiences with it during Calculus 1 or at the High School? No worries!\nIn just 1hr, I\u2019m gonna turn audience into ML rockstars! Machine Learning\nis nowadays expanding. As more data becomes available (and power\ncalculation), so are algorithms that can solve new challenges. But how\ndoes Machine Learning exactly work? And why mathematics shouldn\u2019t be a\nstop? In this speech, I would like to give a brief introduction on the\nMachine Learning field and explain its concepts in the most easiest and\n\u201cHead First\u201d way. Digging in mathematical concepts will be, of course,\nnecessary, but no prior depth knowledge of math will be required, as I\nwill try to keep things as simple as possible.\n\nSpeaker: Gianmarco Forcella\n",
