How to implement a question answering system,\nbased on a TV series wiki - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nHave you always dreamed of providing knowledge to a computer so that it\ncan answer your questions? It is finally possible and easy to do this,\nusing python and the Haystack library. I\u2019ll explain how to quickly\nimplement a Question Answering system, starting from docs about your\nfavorite TV series. Web app:\n\nRepository:\n\nSlides:\n\nHave you always dreamed of providing knowledge to a computer so that it\ncan answer your questions? In this talk, I\u2019m going to present the open\nsource Haystack library: an end-to-end python framework that enables you\nto build powerful and production-ready pipelines for different search\nuse cases, shuch as Question Answering and semantic document search.\nHaystack is modular, so that you can combine the best technology from\nTransformers, Elasticsearch, or Milvus. I present a simple and funny use\ncase, where I quickly and easyly build a Question Answering system,\nstarting from a collection of documents about Twin Peaks TV series. I\nalso provide some theoretical details to make everyone understand how\nthis technology works and I briefly talk about the trade-offs between\nresponse quality, response speed and computational effort.\n\nSpeaker: Stefano Fiorucci\n",
