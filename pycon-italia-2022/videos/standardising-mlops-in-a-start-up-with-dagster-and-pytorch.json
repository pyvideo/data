  "description": "standardising MLOps in a start-up: an example using Dagster and PyTorch\n- PyCon Italia 2022\n\nGood processes and toolings allow companies to adapt and strive with\nchanging business requirements and short development cycles. Using\nDagster, a new workflow engine, and PyTorch, we found the perfect match\nto guarantee reliable deployments with fast-changing models. Join us and\nfind out how! Extending a deep learning model beyond your dataset to\nmake it available to multiple use-cases and stakeholders requires a\nstructured workflow. Finding the proper workflow and tooling depends on\nyour use case, but what happens when your use case is dynamic?\n\nIn a start-up, changing business requirements are standard, so change\nthe inputs, outputs, and model types: the pipeline may be outdated by\nthe time you have put a \u201cmodel in production\u201d.\n\nWith this talk, we want to show a pipeline based on Dagster, deployed on\nKubernetes, and PyTorch, that adds little overhead when making models\navailable to colleagues and projects with minimal requirements, making\nit flexible to handle very customized workflows if needed.\n\nSpeakers: Andrea Giardini, Lorenzo Riches\n",
