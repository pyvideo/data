  "description": "Teaching Python: who, how and what - PyCon Italia 2022\n\n| People consider Python the easiest languange to learn, and they are\n  right, likely. Many students in (non-scientific) Universities think\n  that learning Python is a nightmare, expecially if is mandatory.\n| So, do we have the right strategies to bring our language to all? (I\n  do not, but I am learning) After a few years of courses I realized I\n  (we?) need a strategy to teach Python properly. While it is really\n  exiting to teach PhD students how to make use of a script language in\n  their own projects, it is really hard to show its beauty and\n  opportunities to second year students when they hardly have the\n  concept of a folder, a variable, and if they have them, they are\n  usually quite confused. I would like to share my (little) experience,\n  the good and the bad, so to make a few suggestions for a general and\n  shared approach to teaching: should we introduce levels (A, B, C?),\n  what are the best books to use, how to make exams?\n\nSpeaker: GIANFRANCO DURIN\n",
