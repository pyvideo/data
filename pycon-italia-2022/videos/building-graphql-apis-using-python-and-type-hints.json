  "description": "Building GraphQL APIs using Python and Type Hints - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nGraphQL is an awesome technology that allows to build type safe APIs. In\nthis talk we\u2019ll learn how GraphQL works and how we can use Python\u2019s type\nhints to create GraphQL APIs. GraphQL is a technology to create web APIs\nthat has become quite popular in the past years. In this talk we\u2019ll see\nin detail what GraphQL is, why it exists and why you should use it.\n\nWe\u2019ll also see how we can implement a GraphQL API using Strawberry and\nPython\u2019s type hints. We\u2019ll see why type hints make a lot of sense for\nGraphQL and what kind of issue you might encounter writing GraphQL APIs.\n\nBy the end of the talk you\u2019ll know what GraphQL is, how to implement a\nbasic GraphQL API using Python and what to look out for when working\nwith GraphQL in production.\n\nTarget audience: python developers with familiarities of web APIs (like\nREST). some knowledge of type hints might be useful\n\nSpeaker: Patrick Arminio\n",
