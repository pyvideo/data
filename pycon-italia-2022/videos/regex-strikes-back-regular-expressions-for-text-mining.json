  "description": "RegEx Strikes Back: Regular Expressions for Text Mining - PyCon Italia\n2022\n\nA short time ago in a galaxy not so far away a regular expression was\ntaking 5 days to run. In this talk you will learn why regular\nexpressions can be slow, how to make them fast using a trie regex data\nstructure and the many uses a good old regular expression can have.\nRegular Expressions have a bad reputation, and they are slow (or so they\nsay) for text mining tasks. In this talk you\u2019ll learn why regex can be\nslow and how to use a Trie Regex to craft blazingly fast regular\nexpressions with no effort. How regular expressions integrate smoothly\nwith many libraries (pandas, spacy, etc) and how to use the regex module\nfor common text cleaning tasks such as: prefix finding, fuzzy matching\nand many more.\n\nSlides:\n\nSpeaker: Daniel Mesejo\n",
