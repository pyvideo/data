  "description": "Write Any Python Program in One Line and Only Using Lambdas! - PyCon\nItalia 2022\n\nAny program can be written in just one statement and only using lambda.\n\nSounds weird? The first claim will bring us into what functional\nprogramming is (+ map, functools\u2026); the second one will dig into \u03bb\ncalculus.\n\nBut why? You will learn the power of \u03bb and how to be concise: a better\npythonist! This talk will cover:\n\n-  Recursion! Recursion enables to write simple and concise python code.\n   We will bring many examples of recursion, how to make it fast with\n   memoizing and what tail call optimization is.\n\n-  Mutable vs Immutable objects! Since FP uses a completely immutable\n   approach, this might be the right time to learn about tuples,\n   frozendicts, and all immutable data structures.\n\n-  Higher order functions! You can pass functions as arguments and\n   return them in functions. There are many functions in python that use\n   this feature: sort, min, max, map, filter etc.\n\n-  Functools! Functools is the standard python library containing many\n   useful functional tools. The library functions will be all explained\n   properly, such as partial and reduce, often used in FP.\n\n-  Lambda calculus! \u03bb calculus is the first functional language! In\n   fact, a \u03bb calculus interpreter could be written using exclusively the\n   lambda statement (no loops, numbers, standard functions, libraries,\n   anything).\n\nSpeaker: Niccol\u00f2 \u00abVeggero\u00bb Venerandi\n",
