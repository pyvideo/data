With this\ntalk, you will be surprised how simple, yet powerful, Pattern Matching\nreally is.\n\nThis talk and you, it is a match! \ud83d\udd25 Python 3.10 is out there now. This\nwas a two-digit minor version change since the last release, and with\nthis release new ways of thinking about programming were brought to the\nPython language - Pattern Matching.\n\nWe will understand what was there before Python Pattern Matching and how\nto use Pattern Matching in different scenarios. We will pattern match\nfrom simple data types to more complex ones, such as dictionaries and\nobjects. We will also understand how to use guards, and how can build\ncomposable patterns.\n\nBy the end of this talk, you will be surprised how simple, yet powerful,\nPattern Matching really is. This talk and you, it is a match!\n\nSpeaker: Laysa Uchoa\n",
