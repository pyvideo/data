  "description": "Testing ML Systems: More than just accuracy - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nZillow lost millions because they didn\u2019t have proper MLOps or testing\nprocesses. They relied on the training metrics, like accuracy, but\nSoftware Quality goes beyond that. I will cover different testing types,\ntechniques, and concepts that you can apply to make high-quality ML\nSystems. As ML/AI systems are becoming more prevalent, the need for\nsetting quality standards and testing practices has become crucial.\nTesting these models goes beyond validation metrics like accuracy,\nprecision, and recall.\n\nInstead, quality attributes like model Behaviors, Usability, and\nFairness need to be tested and measured using exploratory and automated\nstrategies.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll cover some of the risks and biases that can happen\nthroughout the MLOps pipeline, demonstrate a few techniques to test a\nmodel\u2019s behaviors and fairness, and apply them against some real-world\nscenarios and state-of-the-art models.\n\nBy the end, you will have new ideas and techniques that you can use to\ntest your own ML/AI systems and approach these quality attributes from a\ncustomer\u2019s perspective.\n\nSpeaker: Carlos Kidman\n",
