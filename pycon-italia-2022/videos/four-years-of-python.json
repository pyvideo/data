  "description": "Four years of Python - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nInspired by my post Four Years of Python where I talk through some\nvaluable lessons for intermediate/beginner programmers to have in mind\nwhen scaling up their career in Python development. I mention topics\nsuch as testing, keeping things simple, and educating yourself. The\nother day I realized: I\u2019ve been programming in Python for about 4 years\nnow. I do get paid to write code, but for some reason still don\u2019t\nconsider myself a pro. I did learn some valuable lessons however. For\nthose who just got started with Python, you\u2019ll hopefully take something\nout of these lessons. For the experienced, see this as a celebration of\nour beloved language.\n\nSome of the topics I\u2019ll cover are: - Reading is better then googling -\nKeep things stupid simple - First make it work, then make it pretty -\nTest early - Learn continuously\n\nI\u2019ll share some learnings, principles, and resources that I\u2019ve learned\nthrough the years.\n\nSlides:\n\nSpeaker: Duarte Carmo\n",
