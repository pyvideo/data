  "description": "Everything You Know About MongoDB is Wrong - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nMongoDB is webscale, right? It\u2019s a JSON database, it\u2019s eventually\nconsistent. Oh, and it\u2019s insecure.\n\nLet me clear up some things: MongoDB is an ACID-compliant database with\ntransactions, schemas & relationships. It includes a powerful\naggregation query language. MongoDB doesn\u2019t store JSON, and nowadays it\ncomes with pretty good security defaults (we think).\n\nI\u2019ll cover all of this and more, so you know what you need to, if you\u2019re\nconsidering MongoDB for your next (or current) project.\n\nSpeaker: Mark Smith\n",
