We expect from\nourselves and from others that we will not introduce bugs and cause\nproblems. That we will use the libraries and APIs as they are intended.\nThat we will not cut corners.\n\nSadly, tales from the industry tell us otherwise. This talk explores why\nwe should not rely on discipline as a bouncer against bugs, and what to\nrely on instead.\n\nSlides:\n\nSpeaker: Nejc Zupan\n",
