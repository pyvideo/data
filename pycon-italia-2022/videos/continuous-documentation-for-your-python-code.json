  "description": "Continuous Documentation for your Python code - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nDo you document your code? Do you think it is important? Imagine that\nyou need to get back to your code in 6 month after you wrote it, there\nis always a big possibility that you will have to spend some time to\nfind out how this code works. This talk will tell you a secret trick\nabout documentation. Do you document your code? Do you think it is\nimportant?\n\nImagine that you need to get back to your code in 6 month after you\nwrote it, there is always a big possibility that you will have to spend\nsome time to find out how this code works. Or if someone else wrote some\ncode, which is already in production and your task is to fix a bug in it\nand there is no documentation and no one actually knows what this code\ndoes.\n\nThere are more benefits of implementing continuous documentation for the\ncode:\n\n-  easy to onboard new team members,\n-  easy to share knowledge,\n-  if this code is open source - easy to start contributing,\n-  easy to see purpose and motivation of each piece of code,\n-  easy to keep versioning for each new release of the code.\n\nIt this talk I will show the difference between documentation types and\nwill show a demo in the end of the talk.\n\nSpeaker: Anastasiia Tymoshchuk\n",
