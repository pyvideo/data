  "description": "Nowcasting financial crisis with deep learning techniques - PyCon Italia\n2022\n\nIn this tutorial, I\u2019ll show how train machine learning models to predict\na financial crisis event in the next 20 days. Specifically, we\u2019ll speak\nabout: - preparation of the dataset - selection of variables with\nRandonForest and Boruta - training and the predictions - measure of our\nperformances This tutorial shows how apply Regression Models and Deep\nLearning Models to nowcasting stock markets crisis events. Specifically,\nwe\u2019ll how the transmission mechanisms across stock markets can be used\nto train machine learning models to predict crisis events. The\ntutorial\u2019ll show the entire pipeline: from the preparation of the\ndataset, how balance observations and how measure our performances.
