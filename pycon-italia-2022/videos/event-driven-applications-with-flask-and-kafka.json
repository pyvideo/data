  "description": "Event Driven Applications with Flask and Kafka - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nLet\u2019s build an event driven application together! Using Flask as\nframework we\u2019ll add the powerful Apache Kafka, a streaming platform, as\nbackend\u2026 all live on stage! Join to understand how to integrate your\napplication with Apache Kafka! Solid event driven applications are based\non a widely adopted coding framework and a resilient data streaming\ntechnology. While Flask is a common choice for the framework, a wise\nselection of the backend data systems can bring benefits in terms of\nease of integration and performances.\n\nIn this session we will explore Apache Kafka, a data streaming platform,\nthat enables reliable real-time data integration for your event driven\napplication. We will look at the types of problems that Kafka is best at\nsolving, and show how to use it in your own applications. We\u2019ll then\ntake a look at Kafka in action, by creating a Flask web application.\n\nAfter understanding how to produce and consume events from Apache Kafka,\nwe\u2019ll then introduce Kafka Connect, a selection of pre-built connectors\nmaking Apache Kafka your only backend interface, no matter where your\ndata originally sits.\n\nIf you\u2019re using Flask, and want to understand how to make your\napplication event driven by integrating it with the most used streaming\ntechnology, this session is for you!\n\nSpeaker: Francesco Tisiot\n",
