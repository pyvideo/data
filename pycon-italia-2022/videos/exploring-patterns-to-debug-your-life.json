  "description": "Exploring Patterns to Debug your Life - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nJust as in code, in our daily life we have patterns that can be\nreturning patterns. Can we debug our life, via debugging skills we\nlearned in coding? Come to experience this talk to learn how to debug\nyour life! In daily life we have patterns and even returning patterns,\nat least if you take time to recognize some parts happening in your\nlife. This can be in your career, customer relations, and even in\npersonal and family relations. Nice patterns lead to success and\ninspiration. Bad pattens leads to bore-out, burn-out or even worse\u2026 In\nthis talk Dennie and special guest speaker Miriam \u2013 a well-known Belgian\nspeaker and experience expert in Autism \u2013 will take you on a journey\nwhere they explain life patterns via metaphors in the tech/ developer\nworld. You will learn how to recognize life patterns exactly as in code,\nengineering, and business patterns. When you recognize the patterns it\u2019s\nfinally time to learn to debug those patterns! Just as you debug code\npatterns with changing the source code, you learn to debug life patterns\nvia changing lifestyle, and in specific thoughts. As you see, those are\njust the same.
