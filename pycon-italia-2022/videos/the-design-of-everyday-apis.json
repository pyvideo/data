  "description": "The Design of Everyday APIs - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nWhat makes a good API for a library? Or more importantly, what makes it\nbad? This talk will discuss the principles of what goes into\nuser-centered design, and how best to apply those principles when\nwriting a Python library for fellow developers. What makes a good API\nfor a library? Or more importantly, what makes it bad?\n\nImplementing an API is an art. It\u2019s the connection between the user and\nthe library itself. How can we optimize that connection to make the\nexperience more pleasing? What makes a user reach for one library over\nanother? What goes into an ergonomic API?\n\nThis talk will first discuss what makes an API good: documentation,\nsimplicity, consistency, completeness, and flexibility. We will apply\nthose elements by looking at developing and iterating on our own\nlibrary.\n\nSpeaker: Lynn Root\n",
