  "description": "Best practices for good(ish) and clean(ish) code - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nA famous book introduction says:\n``The only valid measurement of code quality: WTFs/minute``. In this\ntalk I\u2019d like to share my past and current experience on how to write\ngood and clean code and what to do and not to do to achieve good shape\nprograms. Sounds interesting uh? Have you ever thought what is the cost\nvs revenue of a well written code and of an ugly code? Nowadays, in most\ncompanies, code bases are huge (in terms of lines of code and\ncomplexity) and the number of contributors is also high; this means that\na well shaped code could benefit the company finance and the mental\nhealth of the employees (AKA software engineers).\n\nWriting clean (and/or good) code requires discipline. This discipline\ncan be acquired and increased during your job and doing experience with\nmessy code, but more important is that using discipline, respecting and\nfollowing some rules you can achieve elegant and efficient code.\n\nIn this talk I will cover some principles of clean code (they are too\nmuch for 30 minutes): - Meaningful Names - Formatting - Tests and their\nimportance - Continuous Integration - Code Refactoring - Code Review -\nBoundaries\n\nAll the work contained in this talk is mostly inspired by the book\n``Clean Code - Robert C. Martin (AKA Uncle Bob)`` and the experience I\nhave made during my current job and the previous one.\n\nSpeaker: Ernesto Arbitrio\n",
