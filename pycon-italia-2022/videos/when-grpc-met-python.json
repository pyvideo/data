  "description": "When gRPC Met Python - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nWhat if we can have a tool that helps us to do intelligent load\nbalancing or What if we can do selective compression of the data and\nextremely fast and light weight transfer of data? Then let me introduce\ngRPC, the technology that helps us to do all of this and how can we\nintegrate gRPC with Python. gRPC is one of the most new breakthroughs in\nthe world of client server interaction. Using gRPC our client can\ndirectly make a call to a server on a different machine as if it were a\nlocal object. gRPC has low latency, high scalability and supports\nmultiple use cases for distributed system. We can even build mobile\nclients which can communicate to a cloud server. gRPC uses Protocol\nBuffers which is an open source mechanism for serialising structured\ndata, which makes payloads faster, smaller and simpler. In this talk we\nwill try to understand how can we get started with gRPC in Python.\ngrpcio package of python will be used for the demonstration of the\nexamples and we will cover basics of gRPC as well. We will build a basic\ngRPC service and define protocol buffers for it. Demonstration of how a\nclient and a server can be made through gRPC and how can they\ncommunicate.\n\nSpeaker: Sanket Singh\n",
