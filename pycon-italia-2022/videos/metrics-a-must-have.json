  "description": "/metrics, a must have - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nWith modern applications being distributed, only testing is enough to\nensure your apps are healthy? The web is wild and users are\nunpredictable. Having a good strategy of observability in place is\nessential. In this talk, I\u2019ll demo how to setup extensible metrics in\nyour app using open-source tools With the advent of microservices and\nall that jazz, the complexity of monitoring applications increased quite\na lot. How many instances of my app do I have running? Are they all\nhealthy? How is it performing under heavy load? Questions like that can\nnot be answered by guesses only, but you need data to be more assertive.\n\nIn this talk, we will create a sample web application and instrument it\nusing Prometheus (and potentially other tools such as Grafana, Jaeger,\nAlert Manager, etc) and see in practice how we can monitor web\napplications in real-time.\n\nSpeaker: Luiz Marques\n",
