  "description": "Why is our project late? - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nWhy is it so hard to respect deadlines for a dev team? Is it just a\nwrong planning methodology? Are there fundamental limits in the way our\nbrain makes plans? Has it always been like this?\n\nWe\u2019ll investigate the way humans perceive plans and unexpected events.\nDo we have biases in estimates? Why is it so hard to respect deadlines\nfor a dev team? Is it just a wrong planning methodology? Are there\nfundamental limits in the way our brain makes plans? Has it always been\nlike this?\n\nWe\u2019ll investigate the way humans perceive plans and unexpected events.\nWe\u2019ll find out that we have biases in the way we make plans and\npredictions. Problems are not limited to the planning phase though. When\nthe first issues occur during the project, we tend to take decisions\nlike increasing the team or taking shortcut that might not have the\ndesired outcome.\n\nSpeaker: Marco Santoni\n",
