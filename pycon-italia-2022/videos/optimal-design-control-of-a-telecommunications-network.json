  "description": "Optimal design & control of a telecommunications network - PyCon Italia\n2022\n\nEveryone wants to go faster on the Internet, or design faster networks.\nYou can throw a lot of money to it or you can squeeze every bit from it.\nI\u2019ll show through a research project how can we do the latter and create\nbetter networks. These two years have shown big weaknesses in the design\nand usage of the Internet and many other important enterprise networks.\nA good Quality of Experience and cost-effectiveness are paramount for\nnetwork operators and designers. Enter optimal design and control\u2026\nThrough the use of optimal control it\u2019s possibile to double the\nperformance with respect to how it\u2019s operated today, furthermore it\nallows us to better organize the network in order to minimally distrupt\nthe users in the event of a failure. I\u2019ll show through two examples the\nalgorithms, the theory behind them and the code.\n\nSpeaker: Andi Dulla\n",
