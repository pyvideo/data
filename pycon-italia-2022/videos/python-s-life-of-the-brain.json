  "description": "Python\u2019s Life of the Brain - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nIn this talk, you will learn how to analyse the data coming from the\nhuman brain, how to visualise and process individual neurons, how to\ndesign customised cognitive experiments and finally how to create your\nown brain from scratch in jupyter notebook! There is no need to praise\nPython for its ubiquitousness in various areas of industry or science.\nWe all know about Python applications to engineering, web development,\ndata analysis, or machine learning. But an emerging number of packages\nappear that allow scientists and brain research enthusiasts to analyse\nthe data coming from the brain, visualise and process individual neurons\nfrom various brain areas, design customised cognitive experiments and\nfinally simulate the whole brain in silico! In this talk, you\u2019ll learn\nhow to do that, without leaving your jupyter notebook.\n\nSpeaker: Dominik Krzeminski\n",
