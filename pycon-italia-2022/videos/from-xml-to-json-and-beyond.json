  "description": "From XML to JSON and beyond - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nI want to share my experience on converting XML data to JSON, talking\nabout the existing conventions, some that expect a loss of information\nand others that are lossless, with a focus on conversion methods defined\nby XPath 3.1. JSON has been often described as an XML alternative or\neven a replacement. This can be true in several applications, but many\noften XML persists due to its more richer characteristics and pretty\ndifferent architectural scopes. So crucial is the build of conversion\ntools and mapping conventions, to let the data communication effective\nbetween the different formats. Despite many defined conventions also\nXPath 3.1 put a step in this direction. So don\u2019t trash old XML data, but\nuse them for what is better suited and convert them to send chunks of\nJSON data to other systems or to submit to other applications.\n\nSpeaker: Davide Brunato\n",
