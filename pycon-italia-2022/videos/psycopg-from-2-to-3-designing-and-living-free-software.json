  "description": "Psycopg from 2 to 3: designing and living Free Software - PyCon Italia\n2022\n\nSince it is inception, psycopg2 allowed seamless communication between\nPython and PostgreSQL. But after 15 years and numerous evolutions of\nboth PostgreSQL and Python, a new challenge approached the project: How\ndo we embrace the new ways of doing things while maintaining a stable\ncodebase?\n\nThe answer? psycopg3. A unique occasion to rewrite the library without\nhaving to worry about backward compatibility.\n\nThis talk will go over all the hard design decisions that came with it:\n\n-  What do we keep the same or radically change?\n-  How do we make the migration from 2 to 3 as painless as possible?\n\nSpeaker: Daniele Varrazzo\n",
