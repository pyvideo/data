  "description": "ITK-Wasm combines the Insight Toolkit (ITK) and WebAssembly to enable high-performance spatial analysis across programming languages and hardware architectures.\n\nITK-Wasm Python packages work in a web browser via Pyodide but also in system-level environments. We describe how ITK-Wasm bridges WebAssembly with Scientific Python through simple fundamental Python and NumPy-based data structures and Pythonic function interfaces. These interfaces can be accelerated through GPU implementations when available.\n\nWe discuss how ITK-Wasm's integration of the WebAssembly Component Model launches Scientific Python into a new world of interoperability, enabling the creation of accessible and sustainable multi-language projects that are easily distributed anywhere.",
