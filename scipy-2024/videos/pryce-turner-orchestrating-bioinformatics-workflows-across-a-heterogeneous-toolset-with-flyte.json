  "description": "While Python excels at prototyping and iterating quickly, it\u2019s not always performant enough for whole-genome scale data processing. Flyte, an open-source Python-based workflow orchestrator, presents an excellent way to tie together the myriad tools required to run bioinformatics workflows. Flyte is a k8s native orchestrator, meaning all dependencies are captured and versioned in container images. It also allows you to define custom types in Python representing genomic datasets, enabling a powerful way to enforce compatibility across tools. Computational biologists, or any scientists processing data with a heterogeneous toolset, stand to benefit from a common orchestration layer that is opinionated yet flexible.",
