  "description": "This talk provides an overview of the evolution of scientific software in Python, with a focus on the speaker's journey from creating Spyder (https://www.spyder-ide.org/), the Scientific Python IDE, to developing DataLab (https://datalab-platform.com/), a platform for signal and image processing. The speaker will share insights into the challenges and opportunities encountered in developing and maintaining these projects, and discuss how they have contributed to the scientific Python ecosystem. The talk will also explore the evolving needs of both the scientific and industrial communities during this period, and why desktop applications remain relevant in the era of web-based tools.",
