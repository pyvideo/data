  "description": "Geospatial data is becoming more present in data workflows today, and plenty of Python tools allow us to work with it. In the past year, a new contender emerged: DuckDB introduced an extension for analyzing geospatial data. Everyone in the data world has been buzzing about DuckDB (~15k stars on GitHub), and now this duck quacks geospatial data too. But wait a minute, isn\u2019t DuckDB all SQL? Yes, but fear not, Ibis has you covered! Ibis is a Python library that provides a dataframe-like interface, enabling users to write Python code to construct SQL expressions that can be executed on multiple backends, like DuckDB. In this talk, you will learn how to leverage the benefits of DuckDB geospatial while remaining in the Python ecosystem (yes, we will do a live demo). This is an introductory talk; everyone is welcome, and no previous experience with spatial databases or geospatial workflows is needed.",
