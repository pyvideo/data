  "description": "Do you find yourself copying your data into Word, just to make a table? If this is you (and this was us) it\u2019s both frustrating and prone to errors. And even though every aspect of a typical analysis can be scripted, it often turns out that the table-making part is elusive. We made Great Tables to enable complete publishing workflows. This Python package lets you easily generate publication-quality tables with the structure you want, many options for formatting values, and plenty of freedom for styling. Importantly, Great Tables closely integrates with Pandas and Polars DataFrames in order to handle a wide range of analyses.",
