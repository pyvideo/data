  "description": "A Data Warehouse (DW) is a powerful tool to manage your scientific data, training data, logs, or any other type of relational data. Most Data Warehouses are cloud-based and built to scale to petabyte workflows, but might not be optimal for smaller workloads that need a fast iteration cycle. Likewise, a collection of CSV files and python scripts can become painful to share and maintain. This is where DuckDB comes in! DuckDB is a fast, in-process database that you can run on your laptop, supports a rich SQL dialect, and you can push to the cloud with just a single line of code. In this talk, we\u2019ll show you how to bootstrap a Data Warehouse on your laptop using open source, including ETL (extract-transform-load) data pipelines, dashboard visualization, and sharing via the cloud.",
