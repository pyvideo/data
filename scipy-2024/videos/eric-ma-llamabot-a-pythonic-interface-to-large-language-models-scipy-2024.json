  "description": "In this talk, I will present LlamaBot, a Pythonic and modular set of components to build command line and backend tools that leverage large language models (LLMs). During this talk, I will showcase the core design philosophy, internal architecture and dependencies, and live demo command-line applications built using LlamaBot that use both open source and API-access-only LLMs. Finally, I will conclude with a roadmap for LlamaBot development, and an invitation to contribute and shape its development during the Sprints.",
