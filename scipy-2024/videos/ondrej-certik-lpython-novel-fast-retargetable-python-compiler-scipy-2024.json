  "description": "We are developing a modern open-source Python compiler called LPython\n(https://lpython.org/) that can execute user's code interactively in Jupyter to\nallow exploratory work (much like CPython, MATLAB or Julia) as well as compile to binaries with the goal to run user's code on modern architectures such as multi-core CPU, GPU, as well as unfamiliar, new architectures like GSI's APU, which features programmable compute-in memory. We aim to provide the best possible performance for numerical array oriented code. The compiler itself is written in C++ for robustness\nand speed.",
