  "description": "Scientific software drives open research. However, developing and maintaining a Python package is a tricky endeavor. You need to navigate a thorny packaging ecosystem, often in an academic environment that doesn’t traditionally value software. pyOpenSci has learned that an inclusive community can be empowered to make Python packaging more accessible, and that constructive peer review supports maintainers in creating better software, while also providing academic credit. In this talk you’ll learn:\n\n1. How to build consensus around thorny topics like packaging.\n2. Where to find beginner-friendly packaging support.\n3. How constructive peer review can support better code.\n4. How to get involved with pyOpenSci.",
