  "description": "xCDAT(Xarray Climate Data Analysis Tools) (https://github.com/XCDAT/xcdat) is an open-source Python package that extends Xarray for climate data analysis on structured grids. This talk will cover a brief history of xCDAT, the value this package presents to the climate science community, and a general overview of key features with technical examples. xCDAT\u2019s scope focuses on routine climate research analysis operations such as loading, averaging, and regridding data on structured grids (e.g., rectilinear, curvilinear). Some key features include temporal averaging, geospatial averaging, horizontal regridding, vertical regridding, and robust interpretation and handling of metadata and bounds for coordinates.",
