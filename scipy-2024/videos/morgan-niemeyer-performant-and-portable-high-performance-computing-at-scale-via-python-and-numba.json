  "description": "Monte Carlo / Dynamic Code (MC/DC) is a performant and scalable Monte Carlo radiation transport simulation package with GPU and CPU support. It is written entirely in Python and uses Numba to accelerate Python code to CPU and GPU targets. This allows MC/DC to be a portable, easily installable, single language source code ideal for rapid numerical methods exploration at scale. We will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of such a scheme and make comparisons to traditionally compiled codes as well as those written using other modern high-level languages (i.e., Julia).",
