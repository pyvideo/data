  "description": "We present AstroPhot, a tool to accelerate the analysis of astronomical images. AstroPhot allows for simultaneously modelling images with galaxies and point sources in multi-band and time domain data. In this talk I will the benefits and challenges of how we used PyTorch (a differentiable and GPU accelerated scientific python library) to allow for fast development without sacrificing numerical performance. I will detail our development process as well as how we encourage users of all skill levels to engage with our documentation/tools.",
