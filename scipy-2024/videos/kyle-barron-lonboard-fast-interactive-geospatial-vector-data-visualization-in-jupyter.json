  "description": "Lonboard (https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/) is a new Python library for geospatial vector data visualization that can be 50x faster than existing alternatives like ipyleaflet (https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet) or pydeck (https://github.com/visgl/deck.gl/tree/master/bindings/pydeck). This talk will explain why this library is so fast, how it integrates into existing workflows, and planned future improvements.",
