  "description": "SciPy package scipy.sparse is moving from its matrix API to an array API. This will allow sizes other than 2D, and clean up treatment of the multiplication operator. This talk will start by describing the changes and their impacts. We will then discuss the process of revamping an API without messing up existing user code too much. And the trade-offs between slow changes over many releases vs. faster, perhaps breaking changes. And choosing whether to just make a new package instead. The talk should be useful for users of scipy.sparse and also for packages considering a major API change.",
