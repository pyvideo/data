  "description": "nanoarrow, a newly developed subproject of Apache Arrow, is squarely focused on unlocking connectivity among Python packages and the libraries they wrap using the features and rich type support of the Arrow columnar format. The vision of nanoarrow is that it should be trivial for a library to implement an Arrow-based interface: nanoarrow and its bindings provide tools to produce, consume, and transport tabular data between processes using the Arrow IPC format or between libraries using the Arrow C ABI. For Python maintainers this means less glue code that runs faster so that developers can focus on feature development.",
