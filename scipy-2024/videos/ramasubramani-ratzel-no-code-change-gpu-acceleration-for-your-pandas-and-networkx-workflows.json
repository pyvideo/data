  "description": "With datasets growing in both complexity and volume, the demand for more efficient data processing has never been higher. Pandas and NetworkX, the go-to Python libraries for tabular and graph data processing, are very popular for their ease of use and flexibility. However, they often struggle to keep pace with the demands of large-scale data analysis.\n\nThis talk introduces new open-source GPU accelerators from the NVIDIA RAPIDS project for Pandas and NetworkX, and will demonstrate how you can enable them for your workflows to experience massive speedups \u2013 up to 150x in pandas and 600x in NetworkX \u2013 without code changes.",
