  "description": "Pooch is a Python library that can download and locally cache files from the web without hassle. Novices can use it to simply download files in one line of code and focus on the data. Package maintainers can use it to provide sample datasets to their users, in examples and tutorials, as libraries like SciPy, scikit-image, napari and MetPy do. During this talk, we'll show you how you can use the different features that Pooch offers and also how you can extend its capabilities by writing your own downloaders or post-processors.",
