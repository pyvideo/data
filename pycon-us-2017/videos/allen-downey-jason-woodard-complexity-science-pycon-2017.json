  "description": "Complexity Science is an approach to modeling systems using tools from\ndiscrete mathematics and computer science, including networks, cellular\nautomata, and agent-based models. \u00a0It has applications in many areas of\nnatural and social science.\n\nPython is a particularly good language for exploring and implementing\nmodels of complex systems. \u00a0In this tutorial, we present material from\nthe draft second edition of *Think Complexity*, and from a class we\nteach at Olin College. \u00a0We will work with random networks using\nNetworkX, with cellular automata using NumPy, and we will implement\nsimple agent-based models.\n",
