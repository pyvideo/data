  "description": "``pip`` is a great tool, but dependency management doesn't stop there.\nI'll explore several tools that work with ``pip`` to make managing your\ndependencies easier, faster, and safer. I'll cover generating\ndependencies a better way, maintaining your ``requirements.txt`` for the\nlong-term, and exploring existing Python environments.
