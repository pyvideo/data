  "description": "Everyone needs to debug code, and it can take up a non-trivial portion\nof our time to wait for code to complete execution and write print\nmessages to stdout. There\u2019s one function in particular in the python\ndebugger (pdb) library that can give you a much clearer understanding of\nwhat\u2019s going on in your code, much more quickly; pdb.set\\_ trace(). In\nthis talk, we\u2019ll identify the most useful things you can do when you use\nset trace, that can make debugging exponentially more efficient and\nenjoyable.\n",
