  "description": "Microservices are receiving the buzzword treatment these days, and as\nsuch, they have a cloud of hype surrounding them that makes it hard to\nseparate substance from fluff. In this tutorial, Miguel Grinberg starts\nwith an introduction to this architecture, including what's great and\nnot so great about it, and then teaches you how a traditional monolithic\napplication written in Flask can be refactored into a modern distributed\nsystem based on microservices.\n",
