  "description": "Music is mainly an artistic act of inspired creation and is unlike some\nof the traditional math problems. Music cannot be solved by a simple set\nof formulae. The most interesting and challenging part is producing\nunique music without infringing the copyright. The generated music has\nto sound good, and what sounds good is very subjective and varies from\nculture to culture.\n\nArtificial Neural Network/Deep Learning has a wide range of\napplications, such as in Image processing, Natural language processing,\nTime series prediction, etc. But what about its usage in art? Could we\nuse deep learning to create music?\n\nThis talk is about how deep learning models were used to produce music -\ncatering particularly to Bollywood.\n\nThis talk would show how an exquisite piece of art i.e. music can be\ngenerated using deep learning model which helps in automated feature\nextraction. In order to automate the music generation, the model must be\nable to remember the learned features over the longer period of time,\nthis is achieved by a special type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)\ncalled as LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) network.\n\nImplementation of such complex model can be made much easier using\ninbuilt Python libraries such as Keras with Theano as backend. It allows\nfor easy and fast prototyping. Packages like numpy and scipy are being\nused for easier mathematical computation of input vectors and for\nreading/writing the WAV files respectively. The neural network\narchitecture makes use of numerous amount of music samples to train the\nmodel. After an adequate number of iterations and training time, this\nmodel generates music that is unique and original.\n\nIn this talk, steps involved in preprocessing of data, training the\nmodel, testing the model and generating the music from the trained model\nwill be discussed. This talk will also cover some of the challenges and\ntradeoffs made for algorithmic music generation.\n",
