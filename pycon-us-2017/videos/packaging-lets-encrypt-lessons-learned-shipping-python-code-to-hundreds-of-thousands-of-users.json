  "description": "Let's Encrypt launhced on April 12th 2016, for the first time allowing\nanyone access to free SSL certificates that could be automatically\nfetched and renewed. The demand was massive, and so was the need for a\nclient to fetch these certificates for all of those users. This client\nis called Certbot, and it's written entirely in Python. Unfortunately\nfor the sanity of Certbot developers, these users of Let's Encrypt can't\ndecide on a single operating system to use! This requires us to ship our\nsoftware, and all of its dependencies, to a variety of systems all with\ndifferent web servers, Python versions, package managers,and underlying\npackages. Learn how we got through this mess!\n",
