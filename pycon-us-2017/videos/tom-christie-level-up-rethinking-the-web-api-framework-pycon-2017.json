  "description": "Think there's nothing left to explore in how we design Web API\nframeworks? Think again.\n\nThe author of Django REST framework walks through how we might approach\ndesigning a new Python-based API framework from scratch, and looks at\nhow we can start building smarter, more productive API tooling as a\nresult.\n\nYou should come away from this talk with a better appreciation of:\n\n-  How best to provide API client libraries and API documentation to\n   your users.\n-  How to build APIs that support both realtime and request/response\n   interfaces.\n-  How to build APIs that are web-browsable.\n-  Why you might want to consider taking a schema-first approach to your\n   API design.\n",
