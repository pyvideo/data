  "description": "SQLAlchemy (`http://www.sqlalchemy.org <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`__)\nand Postgres\n(`https://www.postgresql.org <https://www.postgresql.org/>`__) provide\nseveral useful tools that allow us to build and query records through\ntime: *temporal models*. Combining a need to have robust auditing, as\nwell feature development on per-property history, we can turn\n\u201cregulatory overhead\u201d into an exciting technical challenge. At Clover\nHealth we have built a small library to automate the task of decorating\na model and making it \u201ctemporal.\u201d This talk aims to demonstrate the\nunderlying data model and interface for building this system.\n",
