  "description": "Deploy your own cluster! Use it to \"build, ship, and run\" containerized\napplications! Learn how to implement logging, metrics, stateful\nservices, and more! Learn the True Way of DevOps! Alright, we can't\npromise anything about the True Way of DevOps, but everything else will\ndefinitely be in this tutorial.\n\nWe will run a demo app featuring Python components and see some best\npractices to \"Dockerize\" Python code and Flask in particular; but the\ntutorial also includes other languages and frameworks.\n\nCome with your laptop! You don't need to install anything before the\nworkshop, as long as you have a web browser and a SSH client. Each\nstudent will have their own private cluster during the tutorial, to get\nimmediately applicable first-hand experience.\n",
