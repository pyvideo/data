  "description": "Come learn about the Internet of Things and Micropython in this hands-on\nhardware tutorial, no soldering or hardware experience required! We will\nbe building a wifi-enabled temperature sensor as a vehicle for learning\nIoT concepts including data capture, building security into data\ntransmission, and messaging between IoT clients and servers. Attendees\nwill have an opportunity to take their sensors out into the conference\nvenue to take measurements, reconvening to discuss analysis and\nvisualization of IoT data. All the hardware needed will be provided, and\nattendees will be able to program the devices via a locally-hosted web\ninterface.\n\nThis tutorial will be a great introduction for folks interested in\nInternet of Things, Micropython, or hardware hacking. You do not need\nprior experience in any of these topics to attend. We will be using the\nESP8266 micro controller and the MQTT protocol for messaging. Attendees\nshould download the `mosquitto MQTT\nbroker <https://mosquitto.org/download/>`__ in addition to collateral\nthat will be sent out to attendees ahead of the tutorial. We will be\nusing the `WebREPL\ninterface <https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/esp8266/tutorial/repl.html>`__\nfor programming the ESP8266. If you are wondering what the heck all of\nthis means do not despair! These topics will be covered in the tutorial.\n",
