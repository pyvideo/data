  "description": "So you're a data scientist wrangling with data that's continually\navalanching in, and there's always errors cropping up! ``NaN``\\ s,\nstrings where there are supposed to be integers, and more. Moreover,\nyour team is writing code that is getting reused, but that code is\nfailing in mysterious places. How do you solve this? Testing is the\nanswer! In this tutorial, you will gain practical hands-on experience\nwriting tests in a data science setting so that you can continually\nensure the integrity of your code and data. You will learn how to use\n``py.test``, ``coverage.py``, and ``hypothesis`` to write better tests\nfor your code.\n",
