  "description": "Methods are like functions, but different. How? Why? And what's will\nhaving to type \"self\" all the time?\n\nWe'll explore partial application of functions and review why it might\nbe nice to start using classes. Then to clarify how method objects work\nwe'll examine the result of accessing the method attributes of an object\nwithout calling them. Understanding the behavior we uncover here will\nrequire more attribute lookup experiments, which will lead us discover\nthe power of descriptors.\n\nAlong the way we'll peek in at other languages' approaches to method\nbinding, hopefully coming to appreciate the way Python does things\nenough to type \"self\" a few thousand more times.\n",
