  "description": "Did you ever need to create an application whose behavior varies with\nits state, while still presenting a consistent interface to its callers?\nA good, layered design using state machines can help avoid the tedious\n'if' checks for flags, and ensure that if your code runs at all, it will\nrun with all the required values initialized. I will demonstrate this\nwith examples, and talk about some available tools and libraries to\nbuild state machines in Python.\n\nI will also discuss how to effectively use the process of threat\nmodeling to build secure web applications. Threat modeling is a computer\nsecurity technique that helps you better understand the systems you\ncreate, identify attacks, and build defenses. I will talk about things\nthat we, as software developers, can do to assess the security of our\napplications in the real world through this process.\n",
