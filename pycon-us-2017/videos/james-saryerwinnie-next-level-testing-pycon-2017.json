  "description": "Unit, functional, and integration tests are great first steps towards\nimproving the quality of your python project. Ever wonder if there\u2019s\neven more you can do? Maybe you've heard of property-based testing,\nfuzzing, and mutation testing but you're unsure exactly how they can\nhelp you. In this talk we\u2019ll cover additional types of tests that can\nhelp improve the quality and robustness of your python projects:\nproperty-based testing, fuzz testing, stress testing, long term\nreliability testing, and mutation testing.\n\nWe\u2019ll also go beyond just covering what these tests are. For each of the\ntest types above, I\u2019ll give you real world examples from open source\nsoftware that I maintain that shows you the types of bugs each test type\ncan find. I\u2019ll also show you how you can integrate these tests into your\nTravis CI and/or Jenkins environment.\n",
