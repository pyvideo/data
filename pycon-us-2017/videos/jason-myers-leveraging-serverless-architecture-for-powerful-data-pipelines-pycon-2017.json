  "description": "Serverless Architectures that allow us to run python functions in the\ncloud in an event-driven parallel fashion can be used to create\nextremely dynamic and powerful data pipelines for use in ETL and data\nscience. Join me for an exploration of how to build data pipelines on\nAmazon Web Services Lambda with python. We'll cover a single\nintroduction to event-driven programming. Then, we'll walk through\nbuilding an example pipeline while discussing some of the frameworks and\ntools that can make building your pipeline easier. Finally, we'll\ndiscuss how to maintain observability on your pipeline to ensure proper\nperformance and troubleshooting information.\n",
