  "description": "No matter whether you run a web app, search for gravitational waves, or\nmaintain a backup script: being responsible for a piece of software or\ninfrastructure means that you either get a pager right away, or that you\nget angry calls from people affected by outages. Being paged at 4am in\neveryday life is bad enough. Having to fix problems from hotel rooms\nwhile your travel buddies go for brunch is even worse.\n\nAnd while incidents can\u2019t be prevented completely, there are ways to\nmake your systems more reliable and minimize the need for (your!) manual\nintervention. This talk will help you to get calm nights and relaxing\nvacations by teaching you some of them.\n",
