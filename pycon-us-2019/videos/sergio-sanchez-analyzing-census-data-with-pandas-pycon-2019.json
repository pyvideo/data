How about cool `pandas` tricks?\n![pandas_gif](https://media1.tenor.com/images/60379b3ecd5b8d9d886d90018dba63ab/tenor.gif?itemid=5274556)\n\nIn this tutorial you will go from a simple data exploration and analysis  workflow to learning more advanced techniques social scientists apply when dealing with Census data.\n\nIf you've been interested in honing your `pandas` skills or you'd just ___love___ to learn how to calculate the demographically-adjusted employment rate gap for your county using `python`, well you've come to the right place.\n\nThis tutorial is perfect for novice data analysts, pythonistas, social scientists, and journalists that want to learn about the powerful `pandas` library and how to use it to analyze public use micro-data, and for those who've been using it but could learn a trick or two to make their workflow even more effective.\n\nDoes the acronyms ACS, CPS, PUMA, or IPUMS mean anything to you? If not, the more reason to join! Come learn something new!\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides",
