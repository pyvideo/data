  "description": "What do C-Suite Executives Pay Attention To?\nSpeaker: Dingqian (Sara) Liu\n\nSummary\nUsing public listed firms' quarterly earnings call transcripts and Natural Language Processing (NLP), I construct macro attention and micro attention index to measure executives' attention capacity and attention allocation towards macroeconomics. The results indicate that firms expand attention capacity and allocate more attention to macroeconomics during the recession.\n\nDescription\nEveryone has limited attention. They process information from inner communication and outside environment, on which they make decisions based.\nWhy attention capacity and attention allocation towards macroeconomics.\nIntroducing Text Data.\nIntroducing TF-IDF.\nTerm Selection and index construction.\nPresenting attention capacity & allocation for firms with various characteristics\n\nDingqian (Sara) Liu's Bio\nI am an Economics Ph.D. candidate at American University.
