  "description": "What do C-Suite Executives Pay Attention To?\nSpeaker: Dingqian (Sara) Liu\n\nSummary\nUsing public listed firms' quarterly earnings call transcripts and Natural Language Processing (NLP), I construct macro attention and micro attention index to measure executives' attention capacity and attention allocation towards macroeconomics. The results indicate that firms expand attention capacity and allocate more attention to macroeconomics during the recession.\n\nDescription\nEveryone has limited attention. They process information from inner communication and outside environment, on which they make decisions based.\nWhy attention capacity and attention allocation towards macroeconomics.\nIntroducing Text Data.\nIntroducing TF-IDF.\nTerm Selection and index construction.\nPresenting attention capacity & allocation for firms with various characteristics\n\nDingqian (Sara) Liu's Bio\nI am an Economics Ph.D. candidate at American University. My research interests are Corporate Finance, Behavioral Finance and Macroeconomics. Besides being a Ph.D. Candidate, I am an Adjunct Instructor (teaching Economics in Business 2021 Fall), Financial Economist, and a Machine-Learning & Natural Language Processing (NLP) enthusiast.\nGithub: https://github.com/DingqianL/\nWebsite: https://dingqianl.github.io/web//\n\nPyData Global 2021\nWebsite: https://pydata.org/global2021/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pydata-global\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PyData\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
