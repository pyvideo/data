  "description": "An Intro to Workflow Management with Prefect\nSpeaker: Kevin Kho\n\nSummary\nAs data pipelines become increasingly complex and interconnected, workflow management systems are being used to schedule and monitor tasks. Prefect is an open-source workflow management system designed for large-scale data processes. We'll show how to get started with Prefect and also cover how to run Prefect on top of Dask on the cloud to parallelize workflows.\n\nDescription\nWorkflow management systems are used for scheduling and monitoring data pipelines. This includes managing task dependencies, retrying failed tasks, and sending notifications to users. This talk will show data engineers and scientists how to orchestrate their data workflows with Prefect. After this talk, attendees should understand the basics of workflow orchestration and how to get started implementing it for their use cases.\n\nPrefect is an open-source modern workflow management system designed with Dask natively built-in. Prefect can handle large-scale data pipelines with a multitude of small tasks, as users can use the Dask Executor to take advantage of Dask's millisecond-latency task scheduler. Using Dask also parallelizes Task execution and utilizes distributed compute with minimal overhead. In an interactive demo, we'll go over Prefect basic concepts such as Flows, Tasks, and Parameters. We'll then move on to more advanced topics such as mapping and conditional logic, which let us dynamically create Tasks inside a Flow. During the demo, we will deploy a Flow locally, and then show how seamless it is to port the Flow to a Dask cluster on the cloud.\n\nKevin Kho's Bio\nKevin Kho is an Open Source Community Engineer at Prefect, an open-source workflow orchestration management system. Previously, he was a data scientist at Paylocity, where he worked on adding machine learning features to their Human Capital Management (HCM) Suite. Outside of work, he is a contributor for Fugue, an abstraction layer for Pandas, Spark, and Dask. He also organizes the Orlando Machine Learning and Data Science Meetup.\nGitHub: https://github.com/kvnkho/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kvnkho/\n\nPyData Global 2021\nWebsite: https://pydata.org/global2021/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pydata-global\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PyData\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
