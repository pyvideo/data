  "description": "Abstract:\nWe\u2019ll review the state of the art in the data science world for common number-crunching tasks on small to big data. Topics we\u2019ll cover include profiling, compilation and data manipulation. We\u2019ll also review the near future for Numba, Pandas, Dask, Vaex, Modin, and Polars and I\u2019ll help you make some pragmatic choices about tools you might invest time in. We\u2019ll have plenty of time to discuss your use cases and problems you might have encountered.\n\nPlease bring questions about tools or processes that we can discuss during this session.\n\nThis event is for ticket holders, you\u2019ll receive your invite by email. You are strongly encouraged to bring questions and discussion topics for the second half of this session.\n\nBio:\nIan Ozsvald is a Chief Data Scientist and Coach, he\u2019s helped co-organize the annual PyDataLondon conference with 700+ attendees and the associated 11,000+ member monthly meetup.
