  "description": "Extending Jupyter Data Visualizations Beyond the Notebook\nSpeaker: Seth Shelnutt\n\n\nSummary\nThe PyData ecosystem is vibrant, but more can be done to integrate in-notebook visualizations by extending them to the Web, while retaining the ability to dynamically modify renderings easily within Jupyter. We will present lessons learned working between Python, R, JavaScript, and the TileDB data format \u2014 all to make Python Jupyter notebooks the centerpiece of data visualization workflows.\n\nDescription\nPython Jupyter notebooks are the lingua franca of modern data science. While Python has lots of great plotting and data visualization libraries, more can be done to integrate in-notebook visualizations by extending them to the Web, while retaining the ability to dynamically modify data renderings easily within Jupyter.\n\nTileDB is motivated to improve this situation, both as the maintainer of the open-source TileDB Embedded library and its Python API, as well as a commercial service running hosted Python and R Jupyter notebooks for customers. In this talk, we present lessons learned working between Python, R, JavaScript, and even the TileDB data format itself \u2014 all in an effort to make Python Jupyter notebooks the centerpiece of data visualization workflows.\n\nSupporting points:\n\nAutomatically edit & publish interactive R Shiny dashboards straight from Jupyter notebooks.\nAdapting a 3D rendering engine for gaming (Babylon.js) for visualizing 3D point cloud data sets within Jupyter notebooks.\nLearnings from adapting Mapbox GL JS into hosted notebooks with TileDB arrays & vector tile server making TileDB Cloud arrays available to any web client that supports Mapbox Vector Tiles.\nBuilding a notebook versioning UI based on TileDB arrays.\n\nSeth Shelnutt's Bio\nSeth Shelnutt is the CTO of TileDB, Inc where he works to expand and support the open-source initiatives and main product TileDB Cloud. He received his B.S. in Statistics from the University of Florida. His interests primarily revolve around building systems for massive data handling and manipulation. Seth is a regular contributor to open-source software and has worked on developing a new custom storage engine for MariaDB, jupyterlab integrations and distributed computation integrations with Spark and PrestoDB.\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/Shelnutt2/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Shelnutt2/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/seth-shelnutt/\n\nPyData Global 2021\nWebsite: https://pydata.org/global2021/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pydata-global\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PyData\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
