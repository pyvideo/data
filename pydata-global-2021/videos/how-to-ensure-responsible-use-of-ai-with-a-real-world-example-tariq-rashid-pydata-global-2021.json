  "description": "Abstract:\nThe use of data and sophisticated algorithms have mushroomed over the last few years, with startups and large enterprises alike developing innovative products and services. However, concerns around safety, fairness, and ethics have also grown as we\u2019ve seen more and more examples of failure due to bias, poor accuracy and even misapplication of algorithms. In response, governments around the world have developed standards, frameworks, and recently, proposed regulations, for assessing the quality of data-driven automation.\n\nIn this session, we will briefly review the key elements of official guidance on responsible use of data and AI.\n\nWe will then explore an example of an innovative product designed to help the more vulnerable in our communities (based on a real startup product) and, as a group, discuss how we should ensure it is developed to be safe, fair and ethical. We\u2019ll cover not just questions of data and algorithms, but also the development process and governance. By attending this session you will gain an overview of the regulatory direction for AI, and have fun sharing your ideas and learning from others\u2019 approaches to safe, fair and ethical AI.\n\nBio:\nOver 25 years, Tariq Rashid has worked as a technologist in sectors as diverse as nuclear energy, tech startups and central government. Over that time he has observed directly how data and technology can both benefit, and harm, individuals and society.\n\nBringing together his experience in digital services, and his background in machine learning and data mining, he now runs a specialist consultancy providing independent assurance for data-driven automation.\n\nTariq is passionate about community, and runs the Data Science Cornwall and London Algorithmic Art meetups, as well as a children\u2019s code club. He enjoys speaking at, or leading workshops, at community events and conferences.\n\nPyData Global 2021\nWebsite: https://pydata.org/global2021/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pydata-global\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PyData\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
