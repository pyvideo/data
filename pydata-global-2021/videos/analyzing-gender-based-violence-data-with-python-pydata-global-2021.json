  "description": "Analyzing Gender Based Violence Data With Python\nSpeakers: Ivana Feldfeber, Lucy Jim\u00e9nez, Velez Rueda Ana Julia\n\nSummary\nIn this tutorial we want to give the proper tools to work around gender based violence (GBV) data. We will be working with a database from a criminal court in Buenos Aires that has an open gender data policy. We will be showing the attendees how to work with this data from a social and ethical perspective, how to work with Python when we have categorical data.\n\nIvana Feldfeber's Bio\nIvana Feldfeber is a feminist activist from Buenos Aires, and is currently living in Bariloche. Ivana holds two degrees in Education and Social Pedagogy, and she is completing a postgraduate diploma in \"Data Science: Machine Learning and its Aplications\" at the University of C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina. She is the CEO of DataG\u00e9nero. Nowadays she is also a teacher of programming and robotics for children and teenagers. She worked as a data scientist at an online platform, analyzing the data from a social and educational point of view.\n\nShe attended many conferences regarding data in Latin America and realized that no one was talking about gender bias, gender data and feminism. So Ivana decided to create \"DataG\u00e9nero\" a gender data Observatory, the first in the region with a group of scientists, activists and people from different disciplines and countries. https://www.datagenero.org\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/ivanafeldfeber/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ivanafeld/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivana-feldfeber/\nWebsite: https://www.datagenero.org/\n\nLucy Jim\u00e9nez's Bio\nI'm a computational chemist, data scientist, and developer of a scientific platform.\nGitHub: https://github.com/LucyJimenez/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/JimenezLucyJ/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucy-j/\nWebsite: https://wbds.la/\n\nVelez Rueda Ana Julia's Bio\nI am a Postdoctoral Fellow at CONICET Argentina. I am a Bioinformatics professor at the Universidad Nacional de Quilmes and Programming professor at UCEMA. I have created the project \"Bioinformatics goes to school\" and am the co-founder of the Women in Bioinformatics and Data Science LA community.\nGitHub: https://github.com/AJVelezRueda/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AnaJuliaVelezR/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajvelezrueda/\n\nPyData Global 2021\nWebsite: https://pydata.org/global2021/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pydata-global\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PyData\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
