  "description": "Modeling Aleatoric and Epistemic Uncertainty Using Tensorflow and Tensorflow Probability\nSpeaker: Aleksander Molak\n\nSummary\nModeling uncertainty is incredibly useful when we want to understand how sure the model is about its own predictions. In the talk we\u2019ll discuss differences between two types of uncertainty (aleatoric and epistemic) and show how to model them using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Probability. At the end of the talk, you\u2019ll have practical understanding how to apply uncertainty modeling in your own project\n\nDescription\nIs your data scarce? Do you want to understand if adding more will help you solve the problem? These and many other scenarios can benefit immensely from uncertainty modeling. Nonetheless, good understanding of what and how to model is critical to fully enjoy the advantages of this approach. The talk is addressed to people who want to enrich their modeling toolkit. In the talk, we\u2019ll share motivating examples and cover basic theory behind uncertainty modeling. We\u2019ll also briefly introduce basic modules of TensorFlow Probability (TFP). In the main part, we\u2019ll discuss how to model epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty using TFP. We\u2019ll go through a Jupyter notebook, showing the process step-by-step. At the end, I\u2019ll share with you one of my favorite tricks that will allow you to easily model uncertainty in plain TensorFlow. Although the presentation will be focused on tools from TensorFlow universe and therefore might be most rewarding to TensorFlow practitioners, anyone interested in the topic is encouraged to participate. To fully enjoy the content, it\u2019s recommended that you: * Have good understanding of deep learning basics * Have good understanding of Bayes\u2019 theorem * Have practical experience in a contemporary Python deep learning framework (TensorFlow recommended) The goal of this talk is to give you practical understanding of how to apply uncertainty modeling in your own projects.\n\nAleksander Molak's Bio\nInnovation Lead and Machine Learning Researcher at Lingaro\nThe author of #SundayAiPapers - a LinkedIn weekly micro-blog on the latest advancements in NLP, causal inference and more.
