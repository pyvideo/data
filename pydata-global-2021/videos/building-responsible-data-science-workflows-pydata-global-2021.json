  "description": "Building Responsible Data Science Workflows: Transparency, Reproducibility, and Ethics by Design\nSpeakers: Valentin Danchev, Ben Marwick, Dr. Brandeis Marshall (she/her), Kirstie Whitaker, Sara Stoudt, Thibault Lestang, Yacine Jernite\n\nSummary\nDiverse communities have developed principles and tools aiming to harness transparency, reproducibility, research design, software reusability, and more recently, interpretability and fairness of data science and AI/ML/NLP models. This workshop will bring together members of these communities to discuss best ways of integrating such principles and tools into responsible data science workflows.\n\nPyData Global 2021\nWebsite: https://pydata.org/global2021/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pydata-global\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PyData\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
