  "description": "Innovating in the Oil & Gas Industry with AI/ML\nSpeaker: Hoda Rezaei\n\nSummary\nIn this talk we will present the AI/ML applications in the Oil & Gas industry. These solutions are real world use cases we successfully delivered to our clients leveraging an innovative methodology and open source tools.The purpose of this talk is to show engineers and data scientists the art of possible in an industry with huge amount of under-utilized data and traditional proprietary softwares.\n\nDescription\nOil & Gas industry is rich in data and talent but poor in insights and effective data solutions. Legacy Data and Visualization solutions are mainly proprietary and expensive to implement. Further, these solutions lack flexibility and continuous evolution required to deal with various use cases and data sets.\n\nAt Integra we have leveraged our industry experience and love for open source tools to innovate with Data and solve operational challenges in upstream and midstream businesses. We believe in sharing knowledge and building communities that help progress the transformation of Energy industry. In this talk we:\n\nOutline the main roadblocks to adopt AI/ML solutions in the Oil & Gas industry\nIntroduce Integra's methodology to address these roadblocks\nPresent Integra's AI/ML solutions\n\nHoda Rezaei's Bio\nI am a strategic thinker and problem solver focused on adding value to oil and gas industry through innovative approaches. My passion for data and analytics and strong belief in agile and transformative methodologies, drives me to overcome challenges that come my way during the project execution. Using my understanding of the business processes, pain points, and constraints, I map problems to the data, design the solution and lead the project to the right direction. In collaboration with my data science team at Integra Data & Analytic Solutions, I have delivered successful projects in a short time with exceptional outcomes in Pipeline Integrity, SAGD Operation Optimization, Process Optimization, etc.\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/hodarezaei/\n\nPyData Global 2021\nWebsite: https://pydata.org/global2021/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pydata-global\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PyData\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
