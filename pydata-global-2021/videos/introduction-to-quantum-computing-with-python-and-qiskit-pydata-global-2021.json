  "description": "Introduction to Quantum Computing with Python and Qiskit\nSpeaker: Vicente Ruben Del Pino Ruiz\n\nSummary\nA race has started among organizations and nations to achieve Quantum Supremacy. Problems that seemed impossible to solve in the past, now, with the help of Quantum Computing are solved within minutes or hours. Follow me in this talk in my journey to learn how to harness the power of Quantum Computing in data processing using Python and Qiskit.\n\nDescription\nI will start the talk by comparing Classical Computing with Quantum Computing to get familiar how different they are and how to benefit from Quantum Computing.\n\nOnce the audience is familiar with the differences between Quantum Computing and Classical Computing, we'll go through different cases in which it has been proven that Quantum Computing outperforms Classical Computing. We'll wrap up the Quantum Computing introduction with a review of the different Quantum Computers available and how to get access to them.\n\nThe second part of the talk will introduce the audience to Qiskit and IBMQExperience which we'll use in this talk for showcasing Quantum Computing in Python. We'll finish the introduction to Qiskit and IBMQExperience going through the different backends available in Qiskit to run a Quantum Computing program and differences among them.\n\nIn the final part of the talk, we'll cover a Quantum Computing program from beginning to end: which backend to use, how to orchestrate it and which libraries and functions to use in Qiskit. To showcase it, we'll work on a data processing program.\n\nWe'll wrap the talk with a summary of Quantum Computing and Python, benefits, future and next steps.\n\nVicente Ruben Del Pino Ruiz's Bio\nI'm a data professional with more than a decade of experience working on the architecture, design, coding and implementation of Business Intelligence and Data Warehouse environments at scale.\n\nI have implemented big data solutions for more a number of Fortune 20 companies and currently lead Data Engineering solutions at one of the world's largest healthcare companies. I have extensive experience with relational databases like SQL Server and Business Intelligence suites like the Microsoft Stack (Azure and SQL Server), NoSQL databases like MongoDB, CouchBase and Cloud services like Azure and AWS.\n\nIn my free time I like to write technical articles, talk in conferences and experiment with new approaches.\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/vrdelpino/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/vrdelpino/\n\nPyData Global 2021\nWebsite: https://pydata.org/global2021/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pydata-global\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PyData\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
