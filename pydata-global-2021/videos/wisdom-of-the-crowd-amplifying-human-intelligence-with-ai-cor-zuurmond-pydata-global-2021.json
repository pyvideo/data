  "description": "Wisdom of the Crowd: amplifying human intelligence with AI\nSpeaker: Cor Zuurmond\n\nSummary\nTech leaders in non-tech companies face the challenge of combining fuzzy human IP with modern data tools. They must balance traditional processes with innovative algorithms. Their companies aspire to become data driven, which require solid data practices. This talk exhibits how the collective knowledge of an organization can be amplified through inclusive data products.\n\nDescription\nCommodity Trading is digitizing rapidly, and incumbents rely increasingly on data-driven innovation to get an edge on markets. One of the key topics involves price forecasting and predicting trends. We provide a compelling example of how organizations in traditional industries can build successful use cases by:\n\nUsing modern data tools that empower less technical professionals to do heavy data lifting.\nCreating intuitive, simple data products that extract and nurture human intelligence.\nTranslating business values to clear mathematical equations, instead of blindly model.fit().predict().\nThe talk is intended for those who want to apply AI techniques in traditional industries. We propose a technology stack that allows traditional industries to leverage modern data tools to rapidly develop transparent data products.\n\nCor Zuurmond's Bio\nHi there! My name is Cor!\n\nI am demystifying data at GoDataDriven, where I build Azure data platforms and implement data use cases together with our clients. In my talk (see link below) I will show one such use case with Kevin Duisters from Interfood.\n\nWhat I do\nwork as Data Engineer at GoDataDriven\ngive data {science,engineering} training at GoDataDriven\nblog about data\norganize Meetups as committee member of PyData Amsterdam\ndevelop the open source data quality tool: soda-spark\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/JCZuurmond/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CorZuurmond_/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/cor-zuurmond/\nWebsite: https://www.demystifyingdata.io//\n\nPyData Global 2021\nWebsite: https://pydata.org/global2021/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pydata-global\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PyData\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
