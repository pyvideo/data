Want to reduce the hidden costs that come with collaboration? In this hands-on tutorial, we\u2019ll uncover the overlooked parts of making your data science workflow reproducible. You\u2019ll learn about gotchas, reproducibility bugs, and better defaults along the way.\n\nAmy Wooding's Bio\nI believe that our technology should help free us to be our best selves, at work, at home and at play. To that end, I co-founded Learn Leap Labs, where we tackle the challenges organizations face in creative, practical and down-to-earth ways. Our goal is to make the world friendlier, safer, simpler and more human through research, technology, and great UX. My personal specialties include how to learn from data, how to stay safe from bad guys, and how to make people and technology work well together.\nGitHub: https://github.com/acwooding/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/amywooding/\n\nPyData Global 2021\nWebsite: https://pydata.org/global2021/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pydata-global\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PyData\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
