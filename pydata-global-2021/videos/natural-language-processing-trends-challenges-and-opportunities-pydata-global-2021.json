  "description": "Abstract:\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) is one of the most exciting fields in AI, with successful applications ranging from personal assistants, to customer service, to healthcare and many more. In the past few years we have witnessed several breakthroughs in different NLP tasks, as well as the improvement and consolidation of the NLP open-source ecosystem. Despite the buzz, building successful and efficient NLP solutions remains a challenging endeavour.\n\nThis session starts with a short presentation that will offer an overview on the advances, challenges and opportunities in NLP technologies, looking at different modelling solutions and at the Python ecosystem. We\u2019ll then continue with a Q&A / round table discussion. By attending this session, you\u2019ll learn about recent trends in NLP as well as old-but-gold approaches, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to ask your burning questions on NLP, and you\u2019ll hopefully leave more confident and better equipped to tackle your NLP problems.\n\nThis event is for ticket holders, you\u2019ll receive your invite by email. You are strongly encouraged to bring questions and discussion topics for the second half of this session.\n\nBio:\nMarco Bonzanini is a Data Science consultant, corporate trainer and author based in London (UK) specialised in the Python for Data Science (PyData) software stack.
