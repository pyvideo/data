  "description": "Why *Interactive* Data Visualization Matters for Data Science in Python\nSpeaker: Nicolas Kruchten\n\nSummary\nData visualization is a powerful tool for data analysis, although interactivity is often perceived as frivolous or necessary only to communicate with non-data-scientists. This talk will challenge that notion by showing multiple examples of how Python makes it easy to build interactive data visualization that can lead to deeper insights faster than relying only on code and static visualizations.\n\nDescription\nInteractivity in data visualization is sometimes taken by data scientists working in Python as unnecessary, frivolous or mostly useful for communicating with stakeholders when the real work is done.\nMy main claim in this talk is that interactive data visualization is a powerful tool for data scientists throughout their data analysis work, and I want to unpack specific examples of how interactivity can help you get to deeper insights, faster, without having to write a lot more code.\nI will do this by examining interactive data visualizations as a progression through a series of levels, with examples.\nLevel 0 is the interaction loop of modifying a notebook cell to produce a visual, then modifying that cell repeatedly to modify the figure in response to what the last one showed.\nLevel 1 is the use of widgets like dropdowns and sliders around a visual to do the same kinds of things as in level 0, but faster and more smoothly, with a mouse.\nLevel 2 involves direct interaction with a figure: panning, zooming, selecting legend items, hovering and selecting, and I will show how this type of interaction is a very powerful and useful way to get insights about a data set, and far faster and more intuitive than Levels 1 or 0.\nLevel 3 involves linking multiple visual representations of data together to build a tailor-made user interface to solve a data problem. I will demonstrate the common crossfiltering pattern and show how it can reveal patterns.\n\nNicolas Kruchten's Bio\nNicolas Kruchten is VP of Product and Head of Data Visualization at Plotly. He is the current maintainer of Plotly.py, creator of the Plotly Express, react-pivottable and PivotTable.js data analysis tools.

PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
