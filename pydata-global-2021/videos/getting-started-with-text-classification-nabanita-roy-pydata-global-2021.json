In this session, I will demonstrate how to deal with textual data, techniques to derive insights, engineer features from textual data, and use it to solve text classification tasks. This is use-case-driven training where I will work through a text classification task to predict if a tweet is about a real disaster or not.\n\nDescription\nTutorial Summary\n\nNatural Language Processing is an essential skill set for Data Scientists.
