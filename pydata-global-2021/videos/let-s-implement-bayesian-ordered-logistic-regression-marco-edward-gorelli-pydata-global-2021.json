  "description": "Let's Implement Bayesian Ordered Logistic Regression!\nSpeaker: Marco Edward Gorelli\n\nSummary\nIf you work in data science / statistics, you've probably run classification tasks. But what if your categories have some ordering? You might have just used regression and binned the output somehow, but is there a principled, Bayesian way to do this? And what if you have an ordered, categorical feature?\n\nIn this talk, you'll learn how to implement Ordered Logistic Regressor, in Python!\n\nMarco Edward Gorelli's bio\nSenior data scientist at Gousto, Univ of Oxford MSc, pandas maintainer, author of nbQA\nGitHub: https://github.com/MarcoGorelli/\n\nPyData Global 2021\nWebsite: https://pydata.org/global2021/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pydata-global\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PyData\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
