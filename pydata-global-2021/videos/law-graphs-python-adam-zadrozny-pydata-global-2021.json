It is hard to control it due its sparse and vast structure. But it\u2019s hyperlink structure allows us to present it as a graph. By using this and NLP methods we can efficiently visualise its structure and analyse interactions between its parts. In the talk, I will explain how such analysis could be done for Polish and European Law.\n\nDescription\nLegal systems are one of the most complicated human made creations. It is hard to control it due its sparse and vast structure. For a human without completed legal studies it is hard to even get a good glimpse on a small part of it.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at the law from a computer scientist's perspective. It is divided into logical parts Acts, Chapters, Articles, Points, \u2026 . What is more, there are references between relevant parts. So we have a hyperlink structure which allows us to present a legal system as a graph.\n\nBy using this and NLP methods we can efficiently visualise its structure and analyze interactions between its parts. But this leads us to the conclusion that we can use data mining and NLP to consistency checks, detect redundancy or detect involuntary changes due to hyperlink structure.\n\nIn the talk, I will explain how such analysis could be done for Polish and European Law. And how it might help to analyze how the law should be cleaned up after many hurried messy changes were introduced during the pandemic to the legal system. \n\nAdam Zadro\u017cny's Bio\nDr. Adam Zadro\u017cny, astrophysicist working at National Centre for Nuclear Research and lecturer of Natural Language Processing at Cognitive Studies Master Program at Faculty of Psychology at University of Warsaw. In the years 2017-2018 he was postdoc at the Center of Gravitational Wave Astrophysics at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, in 2015 he defended his doctorate at the National Center for Nuclear Research. He took part in the first detection of gravitational waves by the international LIGO-Virgo project. As a PhD student he was an intern at Facebook, Inc. (2012).\nGitHub: https://github.com/zadadam/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-zadro%C5%BCny-58894a67/\n\nPyData Global 2021\nWebsite: https://pydata.org/global2021/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pydata-global\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PyData\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
