  "description": "Feature Stores: an Operational Bridge Between Machine Learning Models and Data\nSpeakers: Jules S. Damji, Danny Chiao\n\nSummary\nFeature stores have emerged as a pivotal component in the modern machine learning stack, as more data scientists and engineers work together to operationalize ML. Associated with this task are some operational challenges. The toughest challenges for operationalizing ML is data: how to compute and select features, store, validate serve, discover and share them.\n\nDescription\nFeature stores have emerged as a pivotal component in the modern machine learning stack, as more data scientists and engineers work together to operationalize ML. Associated with this task are some operational challenges. The toughest challenges for operationalizing ML is data: how to compute and select features, store, validate serve, discover and share them.\n\nIn this talk you will learn:\n\nwhat key problems feature stores solve to operationalize ML\nwhy features stores are a pivotal components in the model machine learning stack\ncommon key use cases and deployment patterns for feature stores observed by the MLOps and ML practitioners\nhow feature stores are playing a transformational role with the rise of modern data platforms\nget a glimpse into a popular open source feature store Feast\n\nJules S.
