  "description": "Using Reproducible Experiments To Create Better Machine Learning Models\nSpeaker: Milecia McGregor\n\nSummary\nIn this talk, you will learn how you can use the open-source tool, DVC, to increase reproducibility for two methods of tuning hyperparameters: grid search and random search. We'll go through a live demo of setting up and running grid search and random search experiments. By the end of the talk, you'll know how to add reproducibility to your existing projects.\n\nDescription\nIt's easy to lose track of which changes gave you the best result when you start exploring multiple model architectures. Tracking the changes in your hyperparameter values, along with code and data changes, will help you build a more efficient model by giving you an exact reproduction of the conditions that made the model better.\n\nIn this talk, you will learn how you can use the open-source tool, DVC, to increase reproducibility for two methods of tuning hyperparameters: grid search and random search.

She will try to make anything with JavaScript first. In her free time, she enjoys learning random things, like how to ride a unicycle, and playing with her dog.\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/FlippedCoding/\nWebsite: https://www.flippedcoding.com/\n\nPyData Global 2021\nWebsite: https://pydata.org/global2021/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pydata-global\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PyData\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
