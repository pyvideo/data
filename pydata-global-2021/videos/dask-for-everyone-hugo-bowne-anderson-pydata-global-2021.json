How does this get deployed? Is it supported? Is it secure? These questions are relevant for other parts of an organization like management and IT, and have not yet been solved by the open source community.\n\nThis talk describes Coiled, a company based around Dask, and how it strives to enable the use of Dask by everyone, everywhere. We'll dive into the opportunities and challenges of OSS/for-profit collaboration, how Coiled has worked in this space so far, and discuss our roadmap for the future.\n\nHugo Bowne-Anderson's Bio\nHugo Bowne-Anderson is Head of Data Science Evangelism at Coiled, a company that makes it simple for organizations to scale their data science seamlessly.
