  "description": "Making the Perfect Cup of Joe: Active Preference Learning and Optimization Under Uncertainty\nSpeaker: Quan Nguyen\n\nSummary\nModeling user preferences over a feature space and efficiently identifying the highest-valued regions is a common problem in machine learning. This talk discusses a solution to this problem that leverages Bayesian optimization. In doing so, we offer a way to model users\u2019 preferences when data is expensive to obtain and comes in the form of pairwise comparisons.\n\nDescription\n\nOptimizing a user\u2019s valuation of a product is a common problem in machine learning (ML), and an attractive solution to this kind of blackbox optimization problem is Bayesian optimization (BO). BO offers a principled way to quickly identify a user\u2019s highest valuation by designing queries that balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. However, a limitation of existing solutions in this framework is that they only work with data on real-valued ratings (e.g., a score of 4 on a 5-point scale asking users to rate a product), and yet in many situations we only have access to information about the user\u2019s preference for a product in one setting over another setting, i.e., pairwise comparison data.\n\nTo learn users\u2019 valuation using these pairwise comparisions, we can leverage a technique called preference learning (PL). This talk presents how BO may be extended to PL, including using a Gaussian Process (GP) for modeling and designing optimization strategies. We will learn how to build an optimization loop of this kind and gain practical skills to do so , such as how to decide which strategy is effective in low- vs. high-dimensional spaces. This talk will benefit ML practitioners who work on human-in-the-loop, A/B testing, product recommendation, and user preference optimization problems. While the talk will cover most background knowledge necessary to implement this optimization technique, the audience should be familiar with common concepts in ML such as training data, predictive models, and multivariate normal distributions.\n\nQuan Nguyen's Bio\nQuan is a Python programmer and machine learning enthusiast.
