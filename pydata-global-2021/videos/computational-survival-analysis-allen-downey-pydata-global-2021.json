  "description": "Computational Survival Analysis\nSpeaker: Allen Downey\n\nSummary\nSurvival analysis is a powerful and versatile set of statistical tools that not enough people know about. They are usually presented mathematically, but in this tutorial we take a computational approach, using Pandas objects to represent survival functions and hazard functions, and to implement basic algorithms of survival analysis, like Kaplan-Meier estimation.\n\nDescription\nIn this tutorial, participants learn the fundamental ideas of survival analysis -- including survival functions and hazard functions -- and implement basic algorithms like Kaplan-Meier estimation.\n\nThe tutorial consists of three case studies, each presented in a Jupyter notebook where the participants can read short explanations, run worked examples, and then work on exercises to practice what they learned.\n\nThe examples come from health, engineering, and social science, but these methods are applicable in other fields, including business analytics.\n\nAllen Downey's Bio\nAllen Downey is a professor of Computer Science at Olin College and the author of a series of open-source textbooks related to software and data science, including Think Python, Think Bayes, and Think Stats. His blog, Probably Overthinking It, features articles on Bayesian probability and statistics. He holds a Ph.D. in computer science from U.C. Berkeley, and M.S. and B.S. degrees from MIT.\nGitHub: https://github.com/AllenDowney/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/allendowney/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/allendowney/\nWebsite: https://www.allendowney.com/wp/\n\nPyData Global 2021\nWebsite: https://pydata.org/global2021/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pydata-global\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PyData\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
