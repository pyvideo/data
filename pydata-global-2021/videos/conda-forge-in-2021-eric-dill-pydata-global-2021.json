You may already be familiar with conda-forge, you may have contributed a recipe, you may not know what conda-forge is or anything else in-between. This talk is for everyone. In this informative talk we will cover a handful of things: the current statistics and metrics for conda-forge; a brief history of conda-forge including why it exists in the first place; all of the different components of conda-forge; and why you might want to get involved and how to do so. There\u2019s really no required knowledge for this talk, though some familiarity with using conda and conda-build will help. By the end of this talk you should feel more comfortable with the conda-forge ecosystem and community. You should feel comfortable knowing where to get started participating in this amazing community.\n\nEric Dill's Bio\nEric is a member of the conda forge core team and has been involved since it\u2019s beginnings at scipy 2015. Professionally, he is currently at Voltron Data product managing their enterprise offering. Previously he has held a variety of roles including Director of data science platform at DTN, Principal Solutions Architect at Anaconda, computational engineer in ad-tech at MaxPoint and assistant scientist and post doc at Brookhaven National Lab. He holds a PhD in Chemistry though was not a particularly good chemist and is much better suited to tech.\nGitHub: https://github.com/ericdill/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Chemisist/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-d-dill/\n\nPyData Global 2021\nWebsite: https://pydata.org/global2021/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pydata-global\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PyData\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
