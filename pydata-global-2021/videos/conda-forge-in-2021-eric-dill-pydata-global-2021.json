You may already be familiar with conda-forge, you may have contributed a recipe, you may not know what conda-forge is or anything else in-between. This talk is for everyone. In this informative talk we will cover a handful of things: the current statistics and metrics for conda-forge; a brief history of conda-forge including why it exists in the first place; all of the different components of conda-forge; and why you might want to get involved and how to do so. There\u2019s really no required knowledge for this talk, though some familiarity with using conda and conda-build will help. By the end of this talk you should feel more comfortable with the conda-forge ecosystem and community. You should feel comfortable knowing where to get started participating in this amazing community.\n\nEric Dill's Bio\nEric is a member of the conda forge core team and has been involved since it\u2019s beginnings at scipy 2015.
