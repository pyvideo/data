    "description": "You likely have a good pipeline that either runs tests, lints, or deployments for your project.\n\nBut when it comes to changing that pipeline, how sure are you that it works before taking those changes live?\n\nIn this talk, we'll explore why it doesn't have to be the case that \"there's no devops for devops\".\n\nWe'll give a quick run down of what pipelines are, and why they should be used, before we give an example where it can be hard to know whether making changes to a pipeline will fail, and why that can be the case.\n\nThen, we'll showcase tools and methodologies that can be used for testing, creating, and simulating pipelines, so you too can setup a system to always be sure that your pipeline changes won't cause any water damage.",
