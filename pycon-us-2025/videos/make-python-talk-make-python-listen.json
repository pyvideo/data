    "description": "Third-party packages for Python allow your programs to perform text-to-speech and speech recognition with only a few lines of code. You don't need to understand advanced machine learning algorithms to take advantage of these sophisticated features: even beginners can use these packages. In this talk, you'll learn the PyTTSx3 and gTTS packages to make your programs talk using your operating system's speech engine. You'll also learn how to use the free, offline Whisper package to convert audio files into text strings. The straightforward configuration for these packages mean you can start making immediate use of them in your Python applications. Finally, we cover the yt-dlp package for downloading video and audio files from the web for transcription purposes, and how all of this is being used by the PyVideo.org website.",
