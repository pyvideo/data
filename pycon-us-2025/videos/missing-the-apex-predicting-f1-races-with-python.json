    "description": "Inspired by, and iterates upon, a paper published in an academic journal, this talk walks throughs through how I used Python to predict Fomula 1 (F1) races. Specifically we talk about the specific challenges related to web scraper, data wrangling, and statistical analysis to try and predict the outcome of F1 races by the evolution of track data over the weekend. Whether beginner or intermediate, or have no familiarity with F1 there's something in here for everyone to learn how to apply Python to their projects.",
