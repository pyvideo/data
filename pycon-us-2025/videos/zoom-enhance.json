    "description": "asyncio in Python 3.14 introduces a new powerful feature: introspecting a running asyncio program from another OS process. This changes everything—now you can debug and profile your asyncio code in production with no performance penalty. Join us for a fun ride as we show how this magic works under the hood and how you can use it. Learn about technical design decisions, performance considerations, security implications, and trade-offs made. Along the way, you’ll gain both beautiful and horrible insights into how asyncio and operating systems interact, and we’ll wrap up with a flawless live demo!",
