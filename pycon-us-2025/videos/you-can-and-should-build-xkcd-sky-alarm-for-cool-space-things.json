    "description": "XKCD is a webcomic by Randall Munroe, and in one of his comics there is a \"Sky Alarm\" [https://xkcd.com/2979/]. It features a small box with a light on top of it, and it goes \"weeee ooooo\" when a \"Cool Space Thing [is] Happening!\".\n\nIf you want one, I've got great news: you can build one and it can run on Python!\n\nCircuit Python let's us extend the Python we know and love into the world around us, and we can use that extension to build alarms when \"Cool Space Things\" happen. Or by adding a sensor or two, we can have it respond to things in our environment.\n\nThis talk walks through a basic build of a \"Sky Alarm\" using Circuit Python. We'll highlight fetching data, selecting a micro controller, making it respond to data on a local server, and adding sensors, and logging data from those sensors for plotting, displays, or more complex functions and analysis. Focusing on a solder free build, this will give you the tools you need to bring Python into the physical spaces around you without needing to be an expert when it comes to electronics and electrical engineering.",
