    "description": "In this talk, we'll zero in on real-world problems blockchain genuinely solves. We'll cut through the jargon and focus on when blockchain makes sense and when it doesn't.\n\nEverything we build will use Python, using libraries and patterns you already know, plus a few lightweight tools to interact with the Algorand blockchain.\n\nWe'll work through hands-on examples: coding trust into peer-to-peer payment systems for underbanked regions, building fractional ownership for previously illiquid assets, and creating self-sovereign digital identity systems that empower users with ownership of their credentials. These aren't hypotheticals—companies are running these solutions in production today, and we'll break down how they do it.\n\nExpect a session that meets you where you are: practical, approachable, and 100% Python. By the end, you'll see where blockchain fits into your toolkit—not as a magic bullet, but as a practical option for specific, thorny problems.",
