    "description": "Have you ever wondered how to turn your Python games into lightning-fast web experiences without compromising speed? In this session, overcome the browser barrier and learn how to create powerful game engines that smoothly connect desktop and web platforms using Pygame, pygbag, and WebAssembly.\n\nStarting with familiar Pygame foundations, discover how pygbag transforms Python games into browser-ready experiences. Learn techniques for managing state, particle effects, and physics computations with near-native performance. Through live demonstrations, explore practical strategies for optimizing rendering and maintaining smooth gameplay across different environments.\n\nBy the end of the talk, learn how to create WebAssembly-powered games that function flawlessly on any platform without sacrificing user experience, and understand the architectural patterns that enable high-performance browser-based game engines.",
