Are you starting your projects with the best intentions, following all best practices, and still feel like your architecture turns weird eventually?\n\nMaybe, it's not your fault! Maybe, the tools or methodology you're using are applying design pressure that you're not cognizant of, but that influences the shape of your code.\n\nThe best way to prevent that is becoming aware of the forces at play.
