    "description": "Every new version of the Linux kernel comes with new features, many of which can be easily used in Python. In this introduction to the world of systems programming in Python, we'll use our favorite language to try out a couple of new features added to the Linux kernel over the past year. Along the way, we'll learn about tools in the Python standard library for interfacing with the operating system and working with C-style data structures.",
