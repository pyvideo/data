    "description": "Japanese is reportedly one of the most difficult languages for English speakers to learn. (FSI language difficulty: https://www.fsi-language-courses.org/...) There are many reasons for this, including the fact that there are three types of characters: hiragana, katakana, and kanji, and that words are not separated by spaces. In this talk, I will first introduce what makes Japanese different from many European languages. Then I will show how Python and natural language processing libraries can be used to support Japanese language learning.",
