    "description": "In Cython in Practice, we'll go over the benefits and challenges of utilizing Cython as a way to utilize legacy C/C++ programs and libraries within Python applications. Cython's capabilities permit users to use Python-like syntax to integrate with existing C code and build their own library and program interfaces accessible from both C and Python. This talk will cover essential tools and workflows for building with Cython and what the interface looks like for integrating with legacy C code, and how to build and package a Cython extension with Poetry and uv.\n\nHowever, utilizing the full powers of Cython is not without its own set of challenges. The presentation will also provide practical insights into common errors encountered during build and runtime phases while developing in Cython. Attendees will learn how to navigate these issues, using a detailed account of the specific obstacles faced when wrapping a legacy C library for Python via Cython. We will discuss different memory management and debugging tools, with a focus on Valgrind, and how to utilize these tools during development in Cython.",
