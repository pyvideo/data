    "description": "Jupyter Notebooks are a fantastic tool that make it very easy to get started on a project. But often, you’ll reach a point where you want to make your code part of a larger system, and you’ll need to change your way of working. You’ll need to go from code that gives you some insights or results to robust, reproducible code that runs automatically. In this talk, I’ll explain strategies that will help you smoothly refactor your code. I’ll introduce tools that will help you, and discuss the skills that you’ll need. Whether you're a data scientist looking to productionize your models or a developer working with data-heavy applications, you'll gain practical knowledge to help you move from exploratory notebooks to robust, scalable systems.",
