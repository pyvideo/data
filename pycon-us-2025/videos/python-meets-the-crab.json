    "description": "Python's simplicity often comes at the cost of performance, especially in computationally-intensive tasks. In contrast, Rust enables one to write low-level code that takes full advantage of the underlying hardware. Furthermore, Rust (just like Python) has a vibrant ecosystem with many great libraries. PyO3 (together with the maturin build back-end) allows you to easily integrate the two languages together and make use of the best of both.",
