    "description": "There's a few popular ways in which we can \"see\" sound. But what do you actually see on those visualizations?\n\nIn this talk, we'll be building short PyScript programs utilizing WebGL for attractive visualization display. We'll cover two fundamental methods (amplitude measurement and frequency spectrum display) and the many fun ways in which those two can be used. We'll start by looking at simple sounds with offline batch processing to represent the audio graphically. We'll finish with realtime audio visualization.\n\nNote: The opinions and perspectives within this video should not be considered official stances of the Python Software Foundation.",
