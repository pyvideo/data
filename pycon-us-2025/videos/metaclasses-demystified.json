    "description": "Metaclasses are among the deep magic of Python, which most developers will ever need. As Python pushes into more and more spaces, and becomes responsible for increasingly complex software, there's a need for elegant solutions to some specific architectural problems; metaclasses are a part of some of those solutions.\n\nIn this talk, you'll learn all about the enigmatic metaclass, and where this often esoteric part of Python actually can come in handy.
