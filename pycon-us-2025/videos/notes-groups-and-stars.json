    "description": "Notes, Groups, and Stars aren't just for concerts - they're also exception-ally useful features for error handling, new in Python 3.11!\n\nIn this talk, we'll explore a neglected corner of Python: exceptions and error handling! What would we like Python to do for us, when our programs do something we didn't expect? How can we help other programmers understand failures in our code?\n\nWe'll take a broad view, starting from fundamentals like exceptions vs return values, before zooming through a history of tracebacks and chaining, and arriving at the glorious present with .add_note(), ExceptionGroup, and except*. You'll leave not just educated but enthused and excited - but perhaps even a ten-ex except-star developer!",
