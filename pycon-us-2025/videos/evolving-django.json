    "description": "At MongoDB, we have several Django enthusiasts who have jumped at the idea of backing a long-term solution to combining MongoDB and Django. Having historically provided support for SQL-based open source frameworks like Entity Framework in .NET/C#, Doctrine in PHP, and many more, we are familiar with the territory. We're happy to say we've successfully created a MongoDB Backend Library for Django and want to share all that we've learned kitting out a new NoSQL backend for a traditionally SQL framework including how we believe we have influenced -- and will continue to influence -- changes in the core Django library.",
