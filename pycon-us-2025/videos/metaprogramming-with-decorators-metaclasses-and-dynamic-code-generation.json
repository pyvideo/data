    "description": "This presentation delves into advanced Python programming techniques related to metaprogramming, which allow developers to write code that can evaluate, modify, or build upon other code.\n\nWe will explore key metaprogramming constructs—decorators, metaclasses, and dynamic code generation—through practical examples and real-world applications. This session will provide the audience with the tools and insights to take advantage of the most advanced Python programming techniques to help them plan, optimize workflows, or write dynamic applications Perfect for intermediate to advanced developers who are ready to take their coding skills to the next level!",
