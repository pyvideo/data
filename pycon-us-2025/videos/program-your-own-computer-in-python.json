    "description": "Using Python to write code for web applications, scientific applications, and data analysis is extremely popular. Those of us who write that sort of code are typically sitting in front of desktop or laptop computers for 6-10 hours a day. And yet, while we may want those machines to do certain tasks for us, for some reason it rarely occurs to many of us to use Python to solve problems on those computers rather than the ones in the cloud.\n\nPerhaps it's just because the APIs for controlling them are so different, and it seems difficult to get started.\n\nIn this talk I will explain how to use Python to integrate with your desktop environment; how to schedule tasks, schedule notifications, and script the applications you already use. We'll have a focus on macOS for demonstration purposes, but will also including pointers to similar tools for desktop Linux and Windows.",
