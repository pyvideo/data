She shared with the audience her perspective, inviting the audience to think always about inclusion when referring to diversity and the many obstacles that get in the way while trying to promote them. Naomi highlighted that society needs more education on the topic of inclusion, take more responsibilities and not leave the solution to the minorities themselves. This requires listening to people representing this minorities and understanding that diversity has many dimensions including economic, gender, race, religion, sexuality among others.\n\nAbout PyCon Colombia 2018\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nWe are excited to share this overview of the second edition of Colombia\u2019s Python Conference: PyCon Colombia 2018  - http://bit.ly/overview-pyconcolombia2018\n\nWe want to say thanks to all our sponsors who helped make the conference a huge success.\n\n\n- The Python Software Foundation -\n- EAFIT University -  http://www.eafit.edu.co/\n- HDE - https://www.hde.co.jp/en/\n- MONOKU - https://monoku.com/\n- SIHSA - https://www.sihsa.co/\n- PSL Latam - https://www.psl.com.co/\n\n\nFollow us\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pyconcolombia\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconcolombia\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/pyconcolombia/\nTelegram: https://t.me/pyconcolombia\nLinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/company/pycon-colombia\n\nMore About PyCon Colombia in http://www.pycon.co\n\nJoin us at our next conference, February 8 - 10, 2019 in Bogota, Colombia.
