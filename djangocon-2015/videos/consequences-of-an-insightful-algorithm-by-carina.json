  "summary": "Consequences of an Insightful Algorithm\n\nWe have ethical responsibilities when coding. We\u2019re able to extract\nremarkably precise intuitions about an individual. But do we have a\nright to know what they didn\u2019t consent to share, even when they\nwillingly shared the data that leads us there? A major retailer\u2019s\ndata-driven marketing accidentially revealed to a teen\u2019s family that she\nwas pregnant. Eek.\n\nWhat are our obligations to people who did not expect themselves to be\nso intimately known without sharing directly? How do we mitigate against\nunintended outcomes? For instance, an activity tracker carelessly\nrevealed users\u2019 sexual activity data to search engines. A social\nnetwork\u2019s algorithm accidentally triggered painful memories for grieving\nfamilies who\u2019d recently experienced death of their child and other loved\nones.\n\nWe design software for humans. Balancing human needs and business specs\ncan be tough. It\u2019s crucial that we learn how to build in systematic\nempathy.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll delve into specific examples of uncritical\nprogramming, and painful results from using insightful data in ways that\nwere benignly intended. You\u2019ll learn ways we can integrate practices for\nexamining how our code might harm individuals. We\u2019ll look at how to flip\nthe paradigm, netting consequences that can be better for everyone.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HIYS/\n",
