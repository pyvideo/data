  "summary": "Leveraging Procedural Knowledge\n\nOn the road to senior developer, one has to learn multiple languages.\nThis often seems like a series of massive obstacles wherein each new\nlanguage resembles a new beginning. However, developers may often\nunderestimate the extent to which procedural knowledge from one language\ntransfers to a new language. In this talk, I will demonstrate that the\nprocess from Red Hat Technical Account Manager to Django Girls workshop\nparticipant to OpenShift developer was a series of procedural knowledge\ntransfers, wherein the obstacles to learning reduces with each new\ntechnology that is learned. I will provide specific examples, from using\neditors to troubleshooting issues, and conclude with practical\nrecommendations on which language to start with and how to create a\ncoherent plan for transitioning from one language to another.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HIXQ/\n",
