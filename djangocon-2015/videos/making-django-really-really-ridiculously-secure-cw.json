  "summary": "Callisto (http://projectcallisto.org/) is an online reporting system\ndesigned to provide a more empowering, transparent, and confidential\nreporting experience for college sexual assault survivors. It's\nabsolutely essential that we keep our user's data secure. So essential,\nin fact, that we couldn't leave it up to developers alone. We'll go over\nwhat Django settings, libraries and practices we used to ensure that on\nthe development end. Then we'll walk through the process of obtaining,\nundergoing, and acting on a formal security audit from a professional\nsecurity firm. You'll find out what they were looking for, what we\nmissed, and how we fixed it, and how you might approach similar\nchallenges for your companies and applications.\n",
