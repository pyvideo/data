  "description": "In this presentation you will learn about:\n\n-  The ``concurrent.futures`` API of Python 3\n-  Threads vs forked processes vs spawned processes (pros and cons)\n-  The impact of the GIL on CPU-bound Python programs\n-  Bad interactions of fork-based multiprocessing and OpenMP runtimes\n-  BLAS-based parallelism (e.g. MKL, OpenBLAS)\n-  Memory bandwidth bound operations, arithmetic intensity and the\n   roofline model.\n\nThis talk will include non-representative micro-benchmarks and silly\nquizzes for the audience :)\n\nWe will also quickly introduce the\n`loky <https://github.com/tomMoral/loky/>`__ project to help mitigate\nsome of the problems.",
