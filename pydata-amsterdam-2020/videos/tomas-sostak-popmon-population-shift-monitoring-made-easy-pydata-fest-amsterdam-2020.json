Tickets are now available: https://global.pydata.org/pages/tickets.html#pricing-and-ticket-purchases\nPart of an underrepresented group in tech? PyData Global is offering Diversity Scholarships. Applications close September 30th: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfcFaTqVFjMa6kWlLPeEynEcbp1WrCxyxMGyyh4BP33eAviaA/viewform\n\nTomas Sostak - Popmon: Population Shift Monitoring Made Easy | PyData Fest Amsterdam 2020\n\nTracking model performance is crucial to guarantee that a model behaves as designed initially. Predictions may be way ahead in time, so the performance can only be verified later, for example, in one year. Taking actions at that point might be already too late. Typical model performance questions are: is the model performing as expected, and are predictions made on current incoming data still valid?\n\nModel performance depends directly on the data used for training and the data to make predictions. Changes in the latter (e.g. certain word frequency, user demographics, etc.) can affect the performance and make predictions unreliable. Given that input data often change over time, it is important to track changes in both input distributions and delivered predictions periodically, and when they differ significantly - take actions. For example, diagnose and retrain an incorrect model in production.\n\nTo make monitoring both more consistent and semi-automatic, at ING we have developed a generic Python package called \u201cpopmon\u201d to monitor the stability of data populations over time, using techniques from statistical process control. In this talk, the speaker will present multiple scenarios of population shift, the motivation and challenges of population monitoring, as well as our open-source solution to these.\n\n===\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. 00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
