Applications close September 30th: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfcFaTqVFjMa6kWlLPeEynEcbp1WrCxyxMGyyh4BP33eAviaA/viewform\n\nCheuk Ting Ho - Open-source in the eyes of a Minority Contributor | PyData Fest Amsterdam 2020\n\nIn the first part of this talk, I will talk about my personal experience in contributing to open-source. From learning how to make a Pull Request on GitHub to maintaining libraries. From attending my first meetup to co-organizing conferences. I will tell you what I observe as a self-identifying female. My opinion on certain events that happened. And what \u201chelp\u201d do we, minorities in the community, need.\n\nIn the second part of the talk, I will change to a more subjective angle to look at the diversity issues in the open-source community, especially in Python and Data Science communities. I will try to address what effort has been made and what more we can do. In the end, I will try to convince you all the be our ally and to do the right thing to make our community more inclusive and diverse.\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
