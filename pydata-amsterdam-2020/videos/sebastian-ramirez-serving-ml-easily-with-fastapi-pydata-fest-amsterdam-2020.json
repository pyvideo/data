Tickets are now available: https://global.pydata.org/pages/tickets.html#pricing-and-ticket-purchases\nPart of an underrepresented group in tech? PyData Global is offering Diversity Scholarships. Applications close September 30th: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfcFaTqVFjMa6kWlLPeEynEcbp1WrCxyxMGyyh4BP33eAviaA/viewform\n\nSebastian Ramirez - Serving ML Easily With FastAPI | PyData Fest Amsterdam 2020\n\nYou know Machine Learning, your models are working well, the team likes the results\u2026 but now you need to \u201cserve\u201d them in an API so that others can interact with it (developers/frontend team/other systems).\n\nIn this talk, you will learn how to easily build a production-ready web (JSON) API for your ML models with FastAPI, including best practices by default. With very little code, you will get automatic/interactive documentation, data validation, authentication, open standards (OpenAPI, JSON Schema, OAuth2), and the best performance available in Python (on par with Go and NodeJS).\n\nOn top of that, you will have autocompletion and type checks in your editor, even for your own data, no matter the complexity of its shape.\n\nThe talk is targeted at Machine Learning practitioners that only know the basics of web development: what is an API, HTTP, JSON, etc. But can be appropriate for anyone interested in building web APIs. It\u2019s a very practical talk showing working code examples.\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. \n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:45 About FastAPI\n2:24 FastAPI Basics\n3:22 Support for type annotations\n4:17 Concise backend code\n6:00 Challenge: serving a machine learning model\n7:33 How API routes and documentation work\n11:30 Parsing HTTP body and query\n18:05 Making ML calls from the API app\n23:20 Data validation of the HTTP body\n28:52 IDE auto-completion and type checks\n30:49 Documenting fields with metadata\n32:57 Declaring mandatory fields and validating requests\n36:56 Performance\n38:27 Additional features\n39:50 About typer and thing libraries\n41:30 Q&A\n\nS/o to https://github.com/mycaule for the video timestamps!\n\nWant to help add timestamps to our YouTube videos to help with discoverability?
