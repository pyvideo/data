  "description": "PyData is excited to announce PyData Global, November 11th - 15th! Tickets are now available: https://global.pydata.org/pages/tickets.html#pricing-and-ticket-purchases\nPart of an underrepresented group in tech? PyData Global is offering Diversity Scholarships. Applications close September 30th: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfcFaTqVFjMa6kWlLPeEynEcbp1WrCxyxMGyyh4BP33eAviaA/viewform\n\nChiel Peters - Python: From Source to Execution | PyData Fest Amsterdam 2020 \n\n\u201cBeautiful is better than ugly\u201d, \u201cSimple is better than complex\u201d and \u201cThere should be one\u2013 and preferably only one \u2013obvious way to do it.\u201d are a few statements from the Zen of Python. They explain the ideology behind the language: a simple, readable but yet powerful programming language. Over the years this has made it into one of the most popular languages in the world, especially within the field of AI.\n\nIn this talk, we will go into the internals of the language and see how source code is executed. Execution in (C)Python is a multi-stage process where source code is first parsed and compiled into an intermediate representation known as Python Byte Code (those .pyc files) before being fed into the interpreter. All of this happens behind the scenes every time you run a program. The presentation will explain each stage from a conceptual level and using practical examples.\n\nAt the end of the talk, the audience will have a better understanding of the internals of Python. They will be able to reason about optimizations within the language, but foremost be able to answer \u201cHow does it work?\u201d.\n\n===\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. 00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
