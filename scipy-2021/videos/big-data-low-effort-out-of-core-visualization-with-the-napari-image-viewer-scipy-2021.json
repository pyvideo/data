  "description": "We present napari: an open source n-dimensional viewer in python. We will cover an overview of the napari viewer and an introduction to extending its functionality through plugins. Finally, we demonstrate a practical case study by loading and interacting with hundreds of Sentinel satellite images and the results of their analysis in near real-time. napari is a General purpose viewer and this Talk will benefit anyone wishing to interact with imaging data beyond the limits of memory in any field including microscopy, astronomy and life sciences. After this Talk youâ€™ll be familiar with many of the tools provided by napari to improve your imaging research workflow.",
