  "description": "The SciPy community has had an enormous impact on the world of science, thanks to an amazingly generous and open group of folks who, for two decades, have shared openly the fruit of their labor. This is probably a good time to reflect not only on these successes, but also on what the new strategic challenges are ahead of us. We don't need to argue about &quot;why open source&quot; at conferences and grant proposals anymore. But do we have the right funding models, career paths, models for interaction with industry, educational integration, etc? Is our community on the right track to grow and diversify in a sustainable way? I'll try to reflect on some of these issues and propose some starting points for both conversation and action. PÃ©rez is a co-founder of the 2i2c.org initiative, the Berkeley Institute for Data Science and the NumFOCUS Foundation. He is a National Academy of Science Kavli Frontiers of Science Fellow and a member of the Python Software Foundation. He is a recipient of the 2017 ACM Software System Award and the 2012 FSF Award for the Advancement of Free Software. He holds a PhD in physics from the University of Colorado, Boulder, and did postdoctoral research in applied mathematics at the same institution.",
