  "description": "Scientific programmers often encounter specialized file formats. Parsing these files so they can be used in Python can be daunting if a parser does not already exist because writing parsers is difficult, error-prone, and time-consuming. Parsita is a parser combinator library for Python that makes it easy to write a parser for a file format or even design a new file format for a domain-specific language of interest.",
