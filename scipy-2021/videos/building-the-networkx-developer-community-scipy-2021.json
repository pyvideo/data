  "description": "NetworkX (https://networkx.org/) is a foundational tool in the scientific Python ecosystem for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. Started in 2002, it is one of the oldest projects in the ecosystem and is widely used for education and network science. Recently, we received funding through the CZI Essential Open Source Software for Science program to revitalize NetworkX. I will discuss the challenges of building and maintaining a healthy development community, provide General lessons for fostering a health developer community, as well as describe pathways for new contributors to become core developers.",
