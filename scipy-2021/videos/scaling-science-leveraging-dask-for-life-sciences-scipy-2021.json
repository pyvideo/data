  "description": "Managing the challenges associated with big data in life sciences can be difficult. Scalable scientific computing is required to cope with the increasing demands of modern biology and neuroscience. Dask is a python library for distributed computation. In this talk, we'll look at several case studies where Dask is used to scale up data processing for life sciences. It will include examples from statistical genetics, single cell analysis, and imaging visualization & analysis. This will give you a better understanding of how you can extend code with Dask to scale your analysis.",
