  "description": "Streamlit is a Python library providing a quick way to turn your scripts into data applications or dashboards. Creating these dashboards can be done in Python without the need to write any HTML or Javascript. First, we will learn how to create static and interactive widgets with Streamlit and work with Python's visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Altair, and Plotly. Next, we will create a dashboard explaining a machine learning model's predictions using SHAP and Anchor explanations. By the end of this Talk, you will be ready to create your own data applications with Streamlit!",
