  "description": "Python tools allow you to create custom web-based visualization dashboards, but previously supported _either_ deep interactivity _or_ efficient rendering of large datasets, and not both. Here we show how to use hvPlot (building on HoloViews, Datashader, and Bokeh) to view millions or billions of datapoints while allowing precise selection and exploration of the details of individual datapoints, all within a single Panel dashboard. Just dump your data in and truly understand it, for the first time, without having to program with events, callbacks, or other advanced mechanisms, and with very little programming required at all.",
