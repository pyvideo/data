  "description": "Sometimes, a middle ground between static plots and hardware accelerated visualizations is required: Videos. This is true in particular when visualizing large quantities of data with limited development time and resources. While the Python ecosystem offers many rather advanced plotting and visualization tools, it lacks a solid and flexible solution for generating videos for advanced scientific visualizations. This Talk gives an overview of the state-of-the art in video generation with Python. It subsequently introduces a new Python package: `bewegung` - a versatile video renderer.",
