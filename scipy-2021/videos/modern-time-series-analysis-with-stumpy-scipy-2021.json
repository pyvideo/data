  "description": "Traditional time series analysis techniques have found success in a variety of data mining tasks. However, they often require years of experience to master and the recent development of straightforward, easy-to-use analysis tools has been lacking. We address these needs with STUMPY, a scientific Python library that implements a novel yet intuitive approach for discovering patterns, anomalies, and other insights from any time series data. This presentation will cover the necessary background needed to follow the live interactive demo, requires no prior experience, and promises a simple, powerful, and scalable time series analysis package that will complement your current toolset.",
