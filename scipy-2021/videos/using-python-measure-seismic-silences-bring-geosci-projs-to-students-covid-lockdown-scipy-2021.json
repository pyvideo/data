  "description": "Lockdown' was a key tool used by governments around the world to stem the movement of people to check the spread of COVID19. I visualized the impact of lockdown on human movements by writing Python algorithms to measure the reduction in seismic vibrations using data from seismic stations across Canada. I created a web application so that anyone can visualize the seismic silences and is available at www.MonitorMyLockdown.com",
