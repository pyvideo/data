  "description": "For large scale Geo projects, such as Natural Resource Management and Conservation efforts, a connection between the GIS and PyData communities goes a long way. With tools like xarray-spatial, coupled with Dask and Numba, GIS professionals can exponentially increase the computing power and scalability of their work for faster results. After this Talk, you will understand how to Generally use Python libraries for Geo applications, without being a software developer: by extracting over the stuff you don't need to know and interfacing with familiar APIs.",
