  "description": "When you\u2019re a big, for-profit project, it can be easy to justify a change from outdated software to the new hotness: figure out why the old software isn\u2019t working for you, do a cost-benefit analysis, and \u2013 if it still seems like a good idea \u2013 make the change.\n\nWhen you\u2019re a community of volunteers, that justification can be less clear: cost-benefit analyses will rarely be about money. Worse still, the human costs can be difficult to justify: It\u2019s difficult to get volunteers to do more unpaid work than they\u2019re already doing. If your community depends on Open Source software, you get the added political difficulty of needing to navigate the divide between large-scale change and making small improvements to systems your community actively contributes to.\n\nWhilst the motivation might be different, the process isn\u2019t: leading a community towards change means understanding why existing systems aren\u2019t suitable, making your community enthusiastic about the need for change, and then actually making that change.\n\nTo help make this point more concretely, we\u2019ll look at how and why linux.conf.au \u2013 a long-running Open Source conference in Australia \u2013 effected a move away away from a bespoke legacy conference management software to one based on Symposion, the popular Django-based software created for the Python Software Foundation. We\u2019ll also look at how that\u2019s led to the PSF funding Registrasion, a Django-based conference sales platform.\n\nWith this case study as a guide, we\u2019ll talk about how to make a decision to replace the software that your community runs on. In particular, we\u2019ll cover how to identify and engage with stakeholders within a community; the value of prototypes in maintaining interest; and what a cost-benefit analysis might look like when your currencies are human joy, and burnout prevention.",
