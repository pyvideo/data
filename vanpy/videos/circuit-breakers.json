  "description": "The inevitability of failures is the bane of scaling any modern web service and can cause serious pain for end users! Lucky for us, there are techniques that can help protect your product and handle failures in subsystems gracefully. This talk will dive into one of these in depth, the Circuit Breaker pattern, and explore the options it gives us for keeping our users safe.\n\nWe will be focusing on several real-world problems and how they can be addressed by circuit breakers. You should expect to leave the talk with details on simple circuit breakers as well as understanding how they can be adapted for more complex situations. We\u2019ll also discuss some options for how to implement your circuit breaker in readable Python.",
