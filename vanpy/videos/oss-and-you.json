  "description": "Open source is nothing if not communities, yet so much about our communities are left to chance. Professional community managers are helping, but change, especially cultural change, must be bottom up as much as it is top down.\n\nIn this talk we\u2019ll look at open source web tech communities and see who gets what right so we can all learn from them. We\u2019ll finish by exploring what every community member can do to shape and improve the communities to which they belong.",
