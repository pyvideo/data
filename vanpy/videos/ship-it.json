  "description": "If we were writing Go or Java it\u2019d be obvious how to distribute the fruits of our labour: compile code and ship the executable. Alas, we\u2019re into Python, where packaging and distribution is not so straightforward. We\u2019ve got sources, distributions, eggs, wheels, native integration - it\u2019s not easy or obvious what you\u2019re supposed to be doing, or even what the options are.\n\nThis talk is about packaging and distributing Python code. It will cover the ecosystem's challenges, the general approaches to solving them, a brief history of major tools, finishing with an overview of the tools that working Pythonistas are likely to encounter in 2016.",
