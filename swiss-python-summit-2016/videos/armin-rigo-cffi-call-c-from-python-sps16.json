  "description": "\"I will introduce CFFI, a way to call C libraries from Python. It was designed in 2012 to get away from Python's C extension modules, which require hand-written CPython-specific C code. CFFI is arguably simpler to use: you call C from Python directly, instead of going through an intermediate layer. It is not tied to CPython's internals, and works natively on two different Python implementations: CPython and PyPy. (It is also a big success, according to the download statistics.) \n\nPyPy is an alternative Python implementation, which is highly compatible with CPython but rewritten from scratch \u2013 in Python. It is much faster than the standard CPython on long-running tasks thanks to its Just-in-Time compiler. I will talk about it during the later part of the talk.\"\n\nTalk recorded at the Swiss Python Summit on February 5th, 2016.\n\nLicensed as Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International.",
