  "description": "Coding/Decoding the Cosmos: Python Applications in Astrophysics\n\n\"Today, Python tools are used almost everywhere in astrophysics: From modelling the images of stars and galaxies seen in modern large telescopes, to statistical analyses of the data products, to inferring the history of our Universe. I will first give a general overview of the kind of Python packages used in the field and then go in to some specific examples of application that I am involved with. These include mapping the dark matter in the Universe and flying drones to calibrate radio telescopes.\"\n\nTalk recorded at the Swiss Python Summit on February 5th, 2016.\n\nLicensed as Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International.",
