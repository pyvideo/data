  "description": "In this talk, I will provide an introduction to the topic of writing middleware for your web applications. Middleware is often simply brought in to an application's code base, without perhaps a thorough understanding of how they work. This talk will shed light on how middleware components work in popular Python web frameworks - Flask, Django and FastAPI.\n\nArmed with that understanding, you will learn how to write your own middleware as well as use standard community contributed middleware to implement vital functionality in your applications.",
