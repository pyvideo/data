  "description": "This talk will take the form of a story of adventurers who meet in tavern, and use graph algorithms to chase down a McGuffin. The goal is to develop an intuition-first understanding of common graph algorithms.\nTarget audience is primarily programmers who want to review, or better understand graph algorithms.\nI will show how to convert mazes, social networks, and maps in to graphs. I will also cover eight algorithms- BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, Hierholzer's, articulation points, centrality, Kruskal's algorithm, and the Louvain method. I will also provide practical (as practical as D&D can get) applications for these algorithms.",
