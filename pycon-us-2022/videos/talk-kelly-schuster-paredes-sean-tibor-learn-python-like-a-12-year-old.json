  "description": "Along the way to adulthood, we often lose that sense of wonder, enjoyment, and playfulness that we had as kids in our favorite school subjects. As adults, we can become better learners ourselves when we examine how kids learn coding with Python. In this session, we\u2019ll talk about making thinking and coding visible, to the brain science behind how we learn new things, to the importance of playfulness in learning. We will share a variety of helpful tips to improve your learning whether you are new to Python or an experienced coder.",
