Ray provides powerful yet easy-to-use design patterns for implementing distributed systems in Python. This tutorial includes a brief talk to provide an overview of concepts, why one might use Ray for distributing Python and Machine Learning workloads, and a brief discussion on Ray\u2019s Ecosystem.\n\nPrimarily, the tutorial will focus on Ray Core APIs to write remote functions, actors, and understand Ray\u2019s basic design patterns for writing distributed Python applications.",
