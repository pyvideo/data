  "description": "Code completion is almost magic, and it makes writing code feel so good. But how does it actually work? I built a code completion engine from scratch - and in this talk, I'll tell you its secrets.\n\nWe'll learn how Python parses and compiles code, what an AST is, and how we can use this knowledge to work out what a programmer might type next. And to prove it's not that complicated, I'll build a little code completer, live on stage, in about five minutes.\n\nI'll also talk about how code completion is like games programming, how we should broaden our thinking about \"types\" in Python, and how we can use information that isn't in your code to make coding even more satisfying.",
