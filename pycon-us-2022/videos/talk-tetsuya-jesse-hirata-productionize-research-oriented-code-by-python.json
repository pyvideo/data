Understand the code through code reading and code documentation\n2. Modularize the code into preparation code, pre/post-process code, calculation code based on the code documents\n3. Refactor the code with test code\n4. Make them products\n\n\u3010Summary\u3011\n\n- Summarize the four steps to productionize research oriented code\n- After making the code products, improve performance and monitor the behaviors of production code",
