  "description": "Sara Issaoun is a NASA Einstein Fellow and observational astronomer at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian. She is a member of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration, the global effort to image and study the environment close to supermassive black holes. Her research centers around the collection, calibration, and imaging of millimeter-wave radio observations of supermassive black holes. Supermassive black holes generate the highest energy processes in the known Universe, ejecting jets of plasma affecting galaxy environments on large scales, but their dynamics and emission mechanisms remain shrouded in mystery. She makes use of global networks of radio-telescopes to image and study the immediate surroundings of the supermassive black holes at the centers of our Galaxy and the galaxy M87.",
