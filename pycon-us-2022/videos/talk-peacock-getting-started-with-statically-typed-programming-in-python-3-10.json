  "description": "Since 2015, it has been possible to write Python like a statically typed language with typing modules and other features introduced in Python 3.5.\n\nThis can significantly improve the development experience and review process.\n\nI have been using type hints in my work for several years and have been studying Haskell and TypeScirpt. I believe this session will be a stepping stone for \"type hints newbies.\"\n\nWhat I will talk about in this talk:\n\n- Advantages of using Typing\n- Getting help from editors\n- Facilitating code reviews\n- How to get started with Typing\n- Argument and return types for functions\n- Using the standard Collections types\n- The difference between tuple and other types\n- Abstract and concrete types\n- Generics, user-defined types\n- Type Hinting Updates in Python 3.9 and 3.10\n- (3.9) Type Hinting Generics In Standard Collections\n- (3.10) Allow writing union types as X | Y\n- (3.10) Parameter Specification Variables\n- (3.10) Explicit Type Aliases\n- (3.10) User-Defined Type Guards\n\nWhat is not covered in this talk\n\n- Basic Python 3 syntax\n- (Not required): Experience developing in statically typed languages\n\nRelated contents:\n\n- A talk at PyCon JP 2020 (JA): https://pycon.jp/2020/en/timetable/?id=203955\n- https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html",
