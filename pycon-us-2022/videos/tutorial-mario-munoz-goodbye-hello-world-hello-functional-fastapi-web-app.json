  "description": "Building a web application with Python is super easy. With just a few lines of code, you can get a simple, working app running directly on your computer's browser.\n\nAwesome! But then what?\n\nThis tutorial focuses on that awkward transition from beginner to intermediate\u2014when you want a project to be less of a sketchpad and more of an actual, useful tool.\n\nWe will learn tactics on how to find and use resources when devising a plan for your web application, as well as hands-on learning for tackling common (and necessary) aspects of building your app, such as configuration, app structure, and database modeling.\n\nFor the training, you will be following along as we build the foundation of a fully-functional web application, and will leave with the ability to further refine it for real-world scenarios.",
