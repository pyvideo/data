  "description": "Python 3.10 was released on October 4th, bringing with it a major new feature: \"structural pattern matching\". As one of the designers of the feature and its principal implementer, my goal is to introduce you to Python's powerful, dynamic, object-oriented approach to this long-established functional programming construct, and to explore ways that you might use structural pattern matching in your own code. Along the way, we\u2019ll also dive into the history of the match statement, the design process behind it, how it actually works, and what we're already doing to improve it in Python 3.11 and beyond.",
