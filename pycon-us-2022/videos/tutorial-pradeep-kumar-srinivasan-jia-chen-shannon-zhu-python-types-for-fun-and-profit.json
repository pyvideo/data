  "description": "Many Python developers now use type annotations to catch and fix bugs early in the coding process. This tutorial will introduce you to type annotations in Python. We\u2019ll cover basic ideas about how types work in a dynamic language like Python, and where explicit annotations can provide value. We\u2019ll then explore features of the type system in more depth, and demonstrate how they can be used to precisely yet flexibly express a huge range of programming patterns.\n\nThroughout the tutorial, you will have the chance to get your hands dirty by learning how to add types to small code snippets as well as to an example GitHub project, and run a type checker to see errors as you code. You\u2019ll get to practice and play around with each concept as we discuss it, and walk away with concrete experience adding types to and catching bugs in real code.\n\nA laptop with Python installed is required along with internet access.",
