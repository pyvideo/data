  "description": "Does your code use datetimes? There's a chance it has bugs that show up every night after 7pm!\n\nTimezones and daylight savings time are problems that plague most systems. Even if your system is designed for use in a singe timezone, you still need to be aware of timezones, both figuratively and literally to avoid bugs (Python datetimes that are correctly instantiated are referred to as \"timezone aware\").\n\nThis talk will cover: * Common mistakes with dates and datetimes in Python * How to use timezone aware datetimes in Python * Recipes for common datetime use cases * Recipes for Django",
