  "description": "Have you ever wanted to prove Python naysayers wrong in that you can have both fast and approachable code with Python? With a few adjustments to standard Python code, you can harness the power of Cython to vastly improve Python performance, while maintaining the look and feel of a traditional Python package. In this talk, common pitfalls in developing with Cython will be discussed in the context of how Cython was used to bring powerful and fast optimization algorithms to a custom geometric form finding add-on for Blender.",
