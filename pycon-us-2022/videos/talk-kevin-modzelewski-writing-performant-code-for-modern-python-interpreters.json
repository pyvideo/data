  "description": "This talk will go into the latest efforts to speed up the Python language, and in particular how some things will be sped up much more than others. You may have heard best practices for Python performance before, but there are some new guidelines now, some old ones are no longer as important, and some are no longer true at all. Come to hear how the Python language is being optimized, and what you can do to best take advantage of these optimizations.",
