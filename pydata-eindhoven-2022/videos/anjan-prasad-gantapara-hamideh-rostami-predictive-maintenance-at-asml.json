  "description": "PyData Eindhoven 2022\n\nIn the chip industry, time is money. Customers of ASML\u2019s lithography systems expect high uptimes. But expected and unexpected maintenance is part of that equation, sometimes requiring to halt the production temporarily.\n\nIn this presentation, we show you how we are building and deploying Machine Learning models to predict upcoming maintenance actions within the upcoming three months. Our work helps to boost productivity, maximize system utilization and reduce unexpected workload for ASML\u2019s customer support.\n\nIn the chip industry, time is money.
