  "description": "PyData Eindhoven 2022\n\nData is everywhere. It is through analysis and visualization that we are able to turn data into information that can be used to drive better decision making. Out-of-the-box tools will allow you to create a chart, but if you want people to take action, your numbers need to tell a compelling story. Learn how elements of storytelling can be applied to data visualization.\n\nData is everywhere. It is through analysis and visualization that we are able to turn data into information that can be used to drive better decision making. Out-of-the-box tools will allow you create a chart, but if you want people to take action, your numbers need to tell a compelling story.\n\nThis talk will show, through numerous examples, how elements of storytelling can be applied to data visualization to uncover the story hidden in your data.\n\nAdditionally, we'll question how objective data visualizations really are. Seemingly small alterations to a chart, such as the title of point of comparison, may drive the viewer to wildly different conclusions. What can you do to guide viewers towards a specific (positive or negative) conclusion? Can a graph be truly neutral?\n\nThis will leave you both with a better understanding of how graphs should be interpreted, as well as the ability to better convey the meaning of your data through visualization.",
