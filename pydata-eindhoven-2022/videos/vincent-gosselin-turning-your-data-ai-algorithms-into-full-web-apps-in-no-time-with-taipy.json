  "description": "PyData Eindhoven 2022\n\nIn the Python open-source eco-system, many packages are available that cater to:\n- the building of great algorithms\n- the visualization of data\n- back-end functions\n\nDespite this, over 85% of Data Science Pilots remain pilots and do not make it to the production stage.\nWith Taipy, Data Scientists/Python Developers will be able to build great pilots as well as stunning production-ready applications for end-users.\n\nTaipy provides two independent modules: Taipy GUI and Taipy Core.\n\nIn this talk, we will demonstrate how:\n- Taipy GUI goes way beyond the capabilities of the standard graphical stack: Streamlit, Dash, etc.\n- Taipy Core is simpler yet more powerful than the standard Python back-end stack: Airflow, MLFlow, etc.\n\nInitially, we will present how a complete graphical interface can be programmed using Taipy GUI's low code syntax (in Python).\n\nWe will then introduce Taipy Core's main concepts: pipelines, scenarios, data nodes, tasks, caching, etc. We will create pipelines graphically from Python IDEs and submit these pipelines for execution. These pipelines will then be \"scenario enabled\" to provide powerful what-if analysis for Data Scientists or End-Users.\n\nFinally, complete Python applications integrating Taipy Core and Taipy GUI will be demonstrated.",
