  "description": "PyData Eindhoven 2022\n\nCode archaeology is figuring out what a thing is for, who built it, and how you can get it to run again.\nDealing with legacy code artefacts (while under time pressure) is something we data people encounter a lot in daily life. I will tell about my experiences from both a research and software engineering standpoint. After quickly going over some common sense approaches, I will dive deeper into real-world archaeology and digital forensics, and find out what we can learn from these fields to make dealing with old artefacts a bit easier. Expect a mix of code and non-code hacks, with ample pop culture archaeology memes.\n\nContents:\n- Code archaeology: why do we do it, and do we need to bring a hat?\n- The basics: common sense approaches to code archaeology\n- What can we learn from real-world archaeologists?\n- What can we learn from digital forensics?",
