  "description": "PyData Eindhoven 2022\n\nIn this talk I hope to convince you that models are not either predictive or causal, but both perspectives should be combined to solve real world problems. I will use a concrete example of how we automate irrigation in greenhouses at Source.\n\nThe causal revolution has taught us that there is a world beyond generating predictions. We now known that not all ML models are suitable for causal inference and have alternatives like double machine learning for causal inference.\n\nDuring this talk, I hope to convince you that the difference between predictive and causal models is not as clear cut as you might think. Using a concrete example of how we control irrigation in greenhouses using machine learning, I will give an example of how to break down a problem into model components that are more or less predictive or causal. Moreover, I hope to give you some practical guidelines on how to decide whether a predictive or causal approach is more suitable for the components of your model.\n\nOutline:\n- Causality warm-up\n- Explanation of irrigation in greenhouses\n- Demonstration of the caveat with predictive models\n- Demonstration of why feature selection matters more then framework selection\n- Brief introduction in double machine learning (full explanation is beyond the scope of this presentation)\n- Demonstration of why double machine learning does not solve the feature selection problem\n- Optional: link to Judea Pearl's causal graphs\n- Explanation of how to isolate part of the problem where you can use predictive models\n- Explanation how this components come together in our solution for irrigation control at Source\n- General advice on how to identify whether to use a predictive or causal approach\n- Conclusion",
