  "description": "PyData Eindhoven 2022\n\nThis talk is about machine learning package development. I will speak about the pains and benefits it causes for developers and share why open sourcing makes the package even better. The talk is not focused on the package itself but rather on common problems so it will be interesting for a wide range of data scientists and python developers.\n\nHave you ever wondered how new open source packages emerge? This talk is exactly about it. I will tell how the idea of a package is born and how it transforms from the proof of concept to the first release version. How business could benefit from it and why the development itself is not the hardest part of open source development. And last but not least, why we changed the architecture of our package three times and why you would too!",
