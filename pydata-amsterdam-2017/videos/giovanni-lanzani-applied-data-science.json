  "description": "PyData Amsterdam 2017\n\nThis is a combination of a talks that I gave at the PyData Amsterdam meetup this year and at various institutions that payed me a good amount of money to tell them what they were doing wrong.\n\nI talk about the data science workflow and where things mostly go wrong. The talk also touches on the type of people that can help companies do applied data science, and what most MOOCs don't teach you.",
