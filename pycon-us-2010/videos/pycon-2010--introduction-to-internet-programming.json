  "description": "Introduction to Internet Programming (Wesley J. Chun)\n\nPython is an interpreted, cross-platform, object-oriented programming\nlanguage that is popular for a wide range of applications, one of which\nis Internet programming. This tutorial introduces current Python\nprogrammers to 3-4 distinct areas of Internet programming, each in\nself-contained lectures with a demonstration of code following each\nlecture topic. Intended Audience\n\nDevelopers familiar with Python who are interested in exploring\nclient/server network programming with sockets, Internet client (FTP,\nNNTP, e-mail), development and web programming.\n\nClass Outline\n\nPython is an interpreted, cross-platform, object-oriented programming\nlanguage that is popular for a wide range of applications, one of which\nis Internet programming. This tutorial introduces current Python\nprogrammers to distinct areas of Internet programming, each in\nself-contained lectures with a demonstration of code following these\nlecture topics (each ranging from 20-60min in length):\n\n-  Network Programming using Sockets\n-  Internet Client Programming\n-  Web/CGI Programming and Concepts\n-  Intro to Django (time-permitting)\n\nWe start at the lowest layer, where one creates communication channels\ndirectly between clients and servers using sockets then move up one\nlevel to discuss well-known Internet protocols such as FTP. Then we move\nup even higher to address the concept of web programming, including a\ndescription and purpose of all \"CGI\" interfaces, and finally, if there's\ntime, to give a high-level quick introduction to one of the most popular\nPython web frameworks today, Django. We'll try build and implement a\nsimple blog in 15-20 minutes! This is especially for those of you who\ncouldn't sign up for the intro to Django tutorial at this PyCon which\nwill likely be full.\n\nAbout the Instructor\n\nWESLEY J. CHUN, MSCS, is the author of Prentice Hall's bestseller, \"Core\nPython Programming\", its video training course, \"Python Fundamentals\"\n(LiveLessons DVD), and co-author of \"Python Web Development with\nDjango\". In addition to being a software architect and Developer\nAdvocate for Google, he runs CyberWeb, a consulting business\nspecializing in Python software engineering and technical training. He\nhas over 25 years of programming, teaching, and writing experience,\nincluding more than a decade of Python. While at Yahoo!, he helped\ncreate Yahoo! Mail and Yahoo! People Search using Python. He holds\ndegrees in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Music from the University\nof California.\n",
