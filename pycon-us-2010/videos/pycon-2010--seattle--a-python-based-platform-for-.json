  "description": "A Python-based Platform for Easy Development and Deployment of Networked\nSystems and Applications\n\nPresented by Ivan Beschastnikh, Justin Samuel, and Justin Cappos\n\nSeattle is an open-source platform for developing and deploying\nnetworked applications. Core feature of Seattle is that it allows safe\nexecution of untrusted code on end-user systems. In our talk we look at\nhow we used Python to build a safe, restricted code execution\nenvironment for Seattle that not only provides execution safety but also\nenforces strict resource consumption limits. In addition, Seattle\nincludes a high-level API to hide inconsistent OS-specific behaviors\nfrom developers. What results is a platform that welcomes the\nparticipation of end-user machines for general-purpose distributed\nprogramming and creates new possibilities for developers.\n\nhttp://seattle.cs.washington.edu/\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Beginning of talk missing, due to technical\nproblems.]\n",
