  "description": "Scrape the Web: Strategies for programming websites that don't expect it\n\nPresented by Asheesh Laroia\n\nDo you find yourself faced with websites that have data you need to\nextract? Would your life be simpler if you could programmatically input\ndata into web applications, even those tuned to resist interaction by\nbots?\n\nYear by year, the web is becoming a stronger force. Learn how to get the\nbest of it.\n\nWe'll discuss the basics of web scraping, and then dive into the details\nof different methods and where they are most applicable. You'll leave\nwith an understanding of when to apply different tools, and learn about\nautomating a full web browser, a \"heavy hammer\" that I picked up at a\nproject for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nAtendees should bring a laptop, if possible, to try the examples we\ndiscuss and optionally take notes. Code samples will be made available\nafter class with no restrictions. Intended Audience\n\nIntermediate (or better) Python programmers, probably without extensive\nweb testing experience\n\nClass Outline\n\n-  My motto: \"The website is the API.\"\n-  Choosing a parser: BeautifulSoup, lxml, HTMLParse, and html5lib.\n-  Extracting information, even in the face of bad HTML: Regular\n   expressions, BeautifulSoup, SAX, and XPath.\n-  Automatic template reverse-engineering tools.\n-  Submitting to forms.\n-  Playing with XML-RPC\n-  DO NOT BECOME AN EVIL COMMENT SPAMMER.\n-  Countermeasures, and circumventing them:\n\n   -  IP address limits\n   -  Hidden form fields\n   -  User-agent detection\n   -  JavaScript\n   -  CAPTCHAs\n\n-  Plenty of full source code to working examples:\n\n   -  Submitting to forms for text-to-speech.\n   -  Downloading music from web stores.\n   -  Automating Firefox with Selenium RC to navigate a pure-JavaScript\n      service.\n\n-  Q&A; and workshopping\n-  Use your power for good, not evil.\n\n",
