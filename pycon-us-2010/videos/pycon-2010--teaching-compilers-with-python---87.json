Focus is put on the main conceptual ideas,\nletting aside many technical details. Still, the students are expected to\nwrite a full compiler within a few weeks' time.\n\nAfter trying the traditional C/Lex/Yacc based approach, and a more education-\noriented Java/Jaccie solution, we settled on Python and PLY, plus a few\nenhancements (syntax tree graphical representation, decorator to achieve\nbetter code separation).\n\nAs a result, the students get a better understanding of the compiler concepts\nand produce more interesting and creative projects.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/241_teaching-compilers-with-python-87.m4v", "tags": ["ply", "pycon", "pycon2010"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": 134437404, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2010TeachingCompilersWithPython87495-873.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
