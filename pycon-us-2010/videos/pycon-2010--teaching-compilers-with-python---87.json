  "description": "Teaching compilers with python\n\nPresented by Dr. Matthieu Amiguet\n\nWhy choose Python to teach compilers?\n\nIn the University of Applied Sciences ARC, compilers are taught in a\nrelatively short amount of time. Focus is put on the main conceptual\nideas, letting aside many technical details. Still, the students are\nexpected to write a full compiler within a few weeks' time.\n\nAfter trying the traditional C/Lex/Yacc based approach, and a more\neducation- oriented Java/Jaccie solution, we settled on Python and PLY,\nplus a few enhancements (syntax tree graphical representation, decorator\nto achieve better code separation).\n\nAs a result, the students get a better understanding of the compiler\nconcepts and produce more interesting and creative projects.\n",
