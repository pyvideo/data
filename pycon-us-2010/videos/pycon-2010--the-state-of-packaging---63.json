  "description": "The state of Packaging\n\nPresented by Tarek Ziad\u00e9\n\nThe Python Package Index (PyPI) became over the last years an essential\ntool to share your Python programs. As long as you use Distutils\nstandards, you can register and upload your work at PyPI in a few\nseconds.\n\nProjects like Setuptools and Pip added great features on the top of this\n: the ability to fetch PyPI to install a project and its dependencies.\nSo you can \"easy\\_install A-Program\" and everything is done\nautomatically for you.\n\nBut all these features have shown the flaws and limitations of the\ncurrent Distutils design, and the urgency to make it evolve with respect\nto the existing OS-specific packaging systems.\n\nThis talk will detail the biggest issues that need to be solved, and the\nwork that is being done. It will end up with a presentation of the\nDistutils roadmap, and an overview of the Distribute project, the\nSetuptools replacer.\n",
