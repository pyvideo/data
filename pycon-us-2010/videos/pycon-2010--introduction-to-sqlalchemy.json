  "description": "Introduction to SQLAlchemy\n\nPresented by Johnathan Ellis\n\nSQLAlchemy is the premier SQL toolkit for Python. SQLAlchemy exposes the\nfull power of SQL while remaining easy to use for the basics, and is\nflexible enough to work with existing database schemas as well as fresh\ndesigns. SQLAlchemy is used in production by leading Python web\nframeworks Pylons and Turbogears as well as many other web and non-web\ndevelopers.\n\nThis tutorial teaches SQLAlchemy's object-relational mapping to automate\npainlessly loading and persisting objects from and to your database,\neven when complex relationships exist.\n\nIntended Audience\n\nPython experience: intermediate. You should already have some hands-on\nexperience with Python and be comfortable reading modern Python code.\n\nSQL experience: beginning. You should know how to SELECT, INSERT, and\nDELETE, and how to read queries involving JOINs, but we will only be\nreading the SQL generated by SA, not writing our own.\n\nORM experience: prior experience with an object-relational mapper is not\nnecessary.\n\nClass Outline\n\nIntroduction:\n\n-  Philosophy\n-  SA features\n\nFundamentals:\n\n-  Introduction to ORM\n-  Data Mapper pattern vs Active Record\n-  Tables\n-  Mapping basics\n\nQueries:\n\n-  Conditions, operators\n-  Joins\n-  lazy / eager loading\n-  Relation-based queries\n\nSessions & identity map:\n\n-  detatching, attaching objects\n-  Lifecycle relations\n\nMore Mapping:\n\n-  one to one, many to many\n-  backreferences\n\nExtensions, etc.:\n\n-  DDL\n-  Migrate\n-  FormAlchemy\n-  SqlSoup\n-  Elixir\n\nRequirements\n\nLaptop with Python 2.5 or 2.6 and SQLAlchemy 0.6 installed. Code samples\nmay also work with Python 2.4 but will not be tested on that platform.\nSQLAlchemy also supports Jython and cPython 3.x, but this tutorial will\nbe using \"classic\" cPython.\n",
