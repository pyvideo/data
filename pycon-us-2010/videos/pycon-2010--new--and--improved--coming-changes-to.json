  "description": "New *and* Improved: Coming changes to unittest, the standard library\ntest framework\n\nPresented by Michael J Foord\n\nIn Python 2.7 and 3.2 a whole bunch of improvements to unittest will\narrive. unittest is the Python standard library testing framework and\nfor several years it has languished whilst other Python testing\nframeworks have innovated. Some of the best innovations have made their\nway into unittest which has had quite a renovation.\n\nThis talk will go through the major changes, like the new assert\nmethods, test discovery and the load\\_tests protocol, and also explain\nhow they can be used with earlier versions of Python.\n",
