It pairs well with ''Python 102'' which follows a\nsimilar outline but goes much deeper.\n\nRather than starting with \"Hello, world!\", we use the interactive Python\ninterpreter shell to get hands-on familiarity with much of core Python before\ncovering blocks and scripts.\n\nThe tutorial is divided into short sections, each with presentation and hands-\non exercises, to quickly cover lots of ground.\n\nAdvanced topics are introduced throughout and covered in \"extra credit\"\nexercises such that more advanced participants can learn at their own pace.\n\nIntended Audience\n\nProgrammers with experience in other languages who want a fast hands-on\nintroduction to Python. Content will target both Python 3.1 and 2.6.\n\nRequirements\n\nBring a laptop computer with Python 2.6 or 3.1 installed. Try to get as much\nof an overview of Python before the tutorial as you have time to in order to\nget more out of the tutorial. Two angles on this are the Python Quick\nReference and the Python website's tutorial.\n\nClass Outline\n\n  * Numbers and operators \n  * Strings - immutability, operators, methods, functions, and formatting \n  * Introspection/Discovery \n  * Tuples and Lists \n  * List Comprehensions \n  * Objects and Names \n  * Dictionaries \n  * Loops and Blocks \n  * Iterables \n  * Generator Expressions \n  * Functions \n  * Generators \n  * Namespaces \n  * Simple Classes \n  * Exceptions \n\nThe handouts at [http://swilliams.ca/python-tutorials](http://swilliams.ca\n/python-tutorials). If you're interested in the software I wrote to deliver\nthe talk drop me a line. My address is in the handouts.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/287_python-101.m4v", "tags": ["pycon", "pycon2010", "python-basics", "tutorial"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": 732203665, "video_ogv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/287_python-101.ogv", "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2010Python101314.png", "video_flv_url": null}
