  "description": "Interfaces, Adapters, and Factories\n\nPresented by Jeff Rush\n\nA step-by-step introduction to the idea of object interfaces and\nadapters using incremental code examples, based on the zope.interface\nmodule. The case for adaption to ease code brittleness will be made and\nhow we can reason about interfaces. I'll show how to automatically check\ncode for conformance to your interfaces and then cover where objects\ncome from, the several kinds of object factories in Python and how one\nkind can be based on interfaces.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Beginning out of focus]\n",
