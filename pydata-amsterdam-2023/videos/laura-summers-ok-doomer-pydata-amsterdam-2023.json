  "description": "AI won't end the world, but it can and is making life miserable for plenty of folks. Instead of engaging with the AI overlords, let's explore a pragmatic set of design choices that all Data Scientists and ML devs can implement right now, to reduce the risks of deploying AI systems in the real world.\n\nLeave the AI boomers to grumble amongst themselves about x-risk and the singularity. Instead let's focus-in on how we can alleviate the real-world harms happening right now.\n\nToo often attempts to identify risks and respond to failure modes of ML and automated systems dive straight into the specifics of model, stack, and implementation. Or worse, add further impenetrable layers of abstraction - the \"more models, more problems\" syndrome. While it's encouraging to see the ecosystem of explainability tools and ML ops surging, as developers and pragmatists we should always prefer the simplest and cheapest tool in our toolkit which is fit for purpose.\n\nThis talk calls attention to a number of existing simple, cheap and effective levers for flagging and reducing risk that are often overlooked.\n\nThese are software design fundamentals like timely and contextual feedback loops, or graceful degradation, that are easily forgotten in the rush to market. These pragmatic tools and product design choices can immediately improve visibility, safety and reduce reputational risk for any team implementing AI.\n\nP.S. Better oversight and tooling for our current tech will, by definition, improve our chances of being alerted if an existentially risky intelligence did happen to emerge from the silicon ether, one day. So it's a win win, really. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nBio:\nLaura Summers\nLaura is a Design Engineer and Prodigy Teams Product Lead at Explosion AI.\n\nShe is the founder of Debias AI, (debias.ai) and the human behind Sweet Summer Child Score (summerchild.dev), Ethics Litmus Tests (ethical-litmus.site), fairXiv (fairxiv.org), the Melbourne Fair ML reading group (groups.io/g/fair-ml).

PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
