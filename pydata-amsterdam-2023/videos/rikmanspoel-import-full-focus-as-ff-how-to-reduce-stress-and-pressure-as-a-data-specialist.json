  "description": "Data science, IT and software development become more and more complex and are subject to increasing requirements and fast-paced business demand. Higher complexity, higher pace and higher quality requirements result in more pressure on our fellow data engineers and data scientists.\n\nMore pressure, but are we resilient enough to withstand that increasing pressure? You have probably already seen its outcome. Unhappiness, stress or even burn-outs of co-workers, instead of creating cool code, great solutions and building a better world using your skills.\n\nHow to change the pressure and stress you perceive as a data scientist, data engineer of ML-engineer? How to ensure that your brain\u2019s frontal lobe returns to a problem solving and decision-making state?\n\nTarget audience\nAll experience levels data engineers, data scientists and analysts. For those who start hitting do\u2019s, don\u2019ts and other hard walls in real life companies and projects. Especially if you experience a drain of energy and focus from those pressure and constrains. Senior or junior, there is much to learn and experience.\n\nTakeaway\nLearn and experience 3 great tools to change your resilience instantly and consistently towards pressure and stress. Not just for yourself, but also be able to see and assist co-workers, family, or other loved ones if they experience stress.\n\nBackground knowledge needed\nNone. Just be sure to bring both your head and body to this workshop to experience how quickly these tools work for you.\n\nTime\n\u2022 0 \u2013 5 Intro and experience tool #1\n\u2022 5 \u2013 15 Control your nervous system and work-related stress\n\u2022 15 \u2013 20 experience tool #2\n\u2022 20 \u2013 25 Your stress and social states (based on polyvagal theory)\n\u2022 25 \u2013 30 experience tool #3\n\nBio:\nMaarten Oude Rikmanspoel\nI love working with both technology and people. Currently working as a freelance data engineer and business intelligence specialist to satisfy the tech part of my heart. Fell in love with Python and the PyData modules in 2017 after unsuccessful relationships with Java and C++ in the past. Applying this in a variety of industries and companies.\n\nIn parallel, I\u2019m creating CalmCode.nl for the past 1,5 years with the aim of guiding software developers, IT- and data specialists towards less stress and burnouts. I\u2019ve seen to many bad examples in the larger companies and multi-nationals where developers almost looked as being oppressed instead of being able to do their work properly and in a nice environment. So the people-oriented part of my heart get\u2019s fuelled when I see people grow and being able to take control of their lives again.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all just walking each other home.\u201d Ram Dass\n\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
