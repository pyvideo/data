  "description": "In this talk, we outline how we introduced causality into our machine learning models within the core checkout and onboarding experiences globally, thereby strongly improving our key business metrics. We discuss case studies, where experimental data were combined with machine learning in order to create value for our users and personalize their experiences, and we share our lessons learned with the goal to inspire attendees to start incorporating causality into their machine learning solutions. Additionally, we explain how the open source Python package developed at Uber, CausalML, can help others in successfully making the transition from correlation-driven machine learning to causal-driven machine learning.\n\nIn this talk, we outline how we introduced causality into our machine learning models within the core checkout and onboarding experiences globally, thereby strongly improving our key business metrics.

PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
