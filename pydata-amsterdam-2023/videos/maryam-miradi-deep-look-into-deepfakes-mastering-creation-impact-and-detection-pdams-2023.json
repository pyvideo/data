  "description": "Deepfakes, a form of synthetic media where a person's image or video is seamlessly replaced using Generative AI like GANs, have recieved significant attention. This talk aims to provide a comprehensive exploration of deepfakes, covering their creation process, positive and negative effects, development pace, and tools for detection. By the end of the presentation, attendees will be equipped with how to create and detect deepfakes, a deep understanding of the technology and its impact.\n\nTalk Outline:\n\nI. How Deepfakes Work (Approx. 8 minutes)\n\nStep-by-step explanation of deepfake creation using an opensource tool\nClarifying the technical aspects behind manipulating existing media with AI algorithms\nII. Deepfakes with GANs (Approx. 8 minutes)\n\nIntroduction to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their role in deepfake generation\nDifferent types of GANs and how to craft realistic deepfakes\nIII. The Good and the Bad (Approx. 8 minutes)\n\nExploring the positive effects of deepfakes\nUnveiling the negative implications of deepfakes\nReal-world examples highlighting the ethical concerns\nSpeculating on the future developments of deepfake technology\nIV. How to Recognize Deepfakes (Approx. 6 minutes)\n\nInsight into the ongoing efforts to combat the misuse of deepfakes\nVarious approaches and AI-driven tools for detecting deepfake media\nUnderstanding the limitations in detecting increasingly sophisticated deepfakes\nKey Takeaways:\n\nIn-depth understanding of deepfake creation and the role of GANs\nAwareness of the positive and negative impacts of deepfakes in different domains\nReal-world examples illustrating the ethical concerns surrounding deepfakes\nInsights into the future trends and advancements in deepfake technology\nFamiliarity with a range of AI-based approaches and tools for detecting deepfakes\n\nBio:\nMaryam Miradi\nMaryam Miradi is AI and Data Science Lead at Transactie Monitoring Nederland (TMNL). She has a PhD in Artificial Intelligence Deep Learning, specialised in NLP and Computer Vision from Delft University of Technology. The last 15 years, she has developed different AI solutions for Organisations such as Ahold-Delhaize, Belastingdienst, Alliander, Stedin and ABN AMRO\n\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
