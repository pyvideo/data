  "description": "Until a few years ago, data science & engineering at Booking.com had grown largely in an ad-hoc manner. This growth has led to a labyrinth of unrelated scripts representing Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) processes. Without options for quickly testing cross-application interfaces, maintenance and contribution grew unwieldy, and debugging in production was a common practice.\n\nOver the past several years, we\u2019ve spearheaded a transition from isolated workflows to a well-structured community-maintained monorepo - a task that required not just technical adaptation, but also a cultural shift.\n\nCentral to this transformation is the adoption of the concept of \"tables as code\", an approach that has changed the way we write ETL. Our lightweight PySpark extension represents table metadata as a Python class, exposing data to code, and enabling efficient unit test setup and validation.\n\nIn this talk, we walk you through \u201ctables as code\u201d design and complementary tools such as efficient unit testing, robust telemetry, and automated builds using Bazel. Moreover, we will cover the transformation process, including enabling people with non-engineering backgrounds to create fully tested and maintainable ETL. This includes internal training, maintainers, and support strategies aimed at fostering a community knowledgeable in best practices.\n\nThis talk is aimed at ETL-adjacent data science practitioners, ideally who have been wondering how to push code quality forward at a data-centric organization.\n\nIntroduction (0-5 minutes): We begin by shedding light on the infrastructure that hosted the old scripts, and discuss our motivation for change. It\u2019s worth mentioning that this transformative decision emerged from individual product teams, not from an executive mandate.\nTables as Code (10 minutes): We'll then introduce the concept of 'tables as code', detailing how this approach enables efficient testing.\nMonorepo Transformation (10 minutes): Building on this foundation, we'll explore how 'tables as code' grew into a vast monorepo with thousands of tests. We'll discuss how we scaled our processes and nurtured this project as a community effort.\nCommunity Growth and Future Plans (5 minutes): In our closing segment, we'll share insights gained from growing this project as a community, highlight strategies for orchestrating training, community support, and finally, share our future plans both within and outside our organization.\n\nBios:\nBram van den Akker\nBram van den Akker is a Senior Machine Learning Scientist at Booking.com with a background in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence from the University of Amsterdam.
