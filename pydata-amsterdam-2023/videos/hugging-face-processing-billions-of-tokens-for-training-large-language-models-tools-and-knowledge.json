  "description": "Keynote by Thomas Wolf. He will be accompanied on stage by Alessandro Cappelli, Julien Launay & Guilherme Penedo, all members of the Hugging Face team in Amsterdam working on large model training.\n\nBio:\nThomas Wolf\nThomas Wolf is a co-founder and Chief Science Officer at Hugging Face. He is passionate about creating open-source software that makes complex research accessible, and most proud of creating the Transformers and Datasets libraries as well as the Magic-Sand tool. When he\u2019s not building OSS, he pushes for open-science in research in AI/ML, trying to lower the gap between academia and industrial labs. His current research interests are centered around overcoming the current limitations of LLMs with multi-modalities and complementary approaches.\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
