  "description": "Exploration of the intersection between data, AI, and environmental conservation. In this talk, we will share our experiences and practical insights during our journey trying to develop a system using Python, camera traps and data-driven techniques to help detect poachers in Africa.\n\nIn this storytelling and informative talk, we will delve into our experience of data and AI to monitor wildlife in parks in Africa. Our objective is to provide attendees with a comprehensive understanding of the applications, challenges, and opportunities of leveraging data-driven techniques in environmental conservation.\n\nAudience : individuals interested in leveraging data for positive impact.\n\nThe talk is accessible to a non-technical audience in its story-telling part, but also contains technical parts and details, as well as a live demonstration of the developed and open-sourced solution. Knowledge of Python and cloud infrastructures may be useful.\nTechnologies explored : Python, Node-RED, Streamlit, Google Cloud Platform, Google Vision API, Zamba, Earth Rangers.\n\nBios:\nMa\u00ebl Deschamps\nManager Machine Learning Engineer, I lead the MLOps Expertise in a team of 20+ Data Engineers & Data Scientist. During my time between Shanghai and Amsterdam I explored 15+ project for 10+ clients working in various industries.\nI find great joy in making both my teams and clients happy. I believe in management through empathy and transparency and I'm passionate about Data Sustainability and all its related technical challenges.\nFeel free to reach-out to discuss any of those topics.\n\nSimone Gayed Said\nHello Hello! \ud83c\udf1f I'm Simone, I work as a Machine Learning engineer, and I'm all about using my skills to make a positive impact on the World! \ud83d\ude80\u2728\n\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
