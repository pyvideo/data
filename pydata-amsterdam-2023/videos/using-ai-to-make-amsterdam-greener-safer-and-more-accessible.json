  "description": "In this talk, we would like to introduce you to the urban challenges that the City of Amsterdam is trying to solve using AI. We will walk you through the technical details behind one of our projects and invite you to join us in the ethical development of cool AI applications for social good.\n\nThe City of Amsterdam has the mission of promoting the development of artificial intelligence to improve the lives of Amsterdam\u2019s residents. We conduct cutting-edge research into the analysis of text, images, and point cloud data, all with the aim of solving the urban challenges of our generation and the ones to come.\n\nRecently, we\u2019ve been working on making our city more inclusive by mapping accessibility infrastructure in the public space. We\u2019ve been also working on making the city safer by localizing all street lights and automatically extracting some of their characteristics. Finally, our analysis of trees and greenery in the city can help increase the city's biodiversity and also help us reach our climate goals.\n\nWorking in the public sector means that technology itself is only a part of our job. On a daily basis, we also need to ensure that all development is done according to our city\u2019s values \u2013 for example, that applications benefit everyone, that we are open and transparent, and that we give citizens a say in shaping their (digital) city. This means (at the very least) that open-source development and the publication of methodology, data, and insights for all of our algorithms are an inseparable part of work.\n\nIn this talk, we would like to introduce you to the challenges that we face, walk you through the technical details behind one of our projects, and share the related open-source materials that can be reused by the PyData community. Finally, we hope to inspire you to join us in the ethical development of cool AI applications for social good.\n\nBios:\nShayla Jansen\nShayla is a data scientist at the City of Amsterdam, part of the dedicated Urban Innovation and R&D Team which aims to improve the livability of Amsterdam by bringing AI research to the city.\n\nNiek IJzerman\nNiek is a data scientist at the City of Amsterdam, part of the dedicated Urban Innovation and R&D Team. Niek is a recent graduate from the MSc AI program at the UvA and currently focusses on automated asset management in 3D using AI and Data Science.\n\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
