  "description": "Feature Stores are a vital part of the MLOps stack for managing machine learning features and ensuring data consistency. This talk introduces Feature Stores and the underlying data management architecture. We\u2019ll then discuss the challenges and learnings of integrating DuckDB and Arrow Flight into the our Feature Store platform, and share benchmarks showing up to 30x speedups compared to Spark/Hive. Discover how DuckDB and ArrowFlight can also speedup your data management and machine learning pipelines.\n\nIn this talk, we will cover the following topics:\n\n\u2022 Introduction to Machine Learning Feature Stores (5 min): Understanding the role of feature stores in the MLOps stack and their significance in managing machine learning features within organizations.\n\u2022 Data management architecture behind Feature Stores (2-3 min): Exploring the underlying mechanisms and data management components employed in feature stores.\n\u2022 Introduction to DuckDB and Arrow Flight (5 min): Highlighting the integration of DuckDB and Arrow Flight into the PyData ecosystem, leveraging the capabilities of Arrow.\n\u2022 The journey of integrating DuckDB and Arrow Flight into our Feature Store platform (12 min): Sharing our experiences and insights on integrating DuckDB and Arrow Flight into the Hudi-based Lakehouse platform that powers our (offline) feature store, discussing challenges and successes encountered along the way.\n\u2022 Benchmarks (5 min): Presenting a benchmark comparing the performance of DuckDB/Arrow Flight vs Spark/HiveServer2, in particular for small to medium sized data.\n\nAttendees will gain a deeper understanding of feature stores, insights into the integration of DuckDB and ArrowFlight into the PyData ecosystem, and practical knowledge on enhancing the performance of machine learning pipelines.\n\nBio:\nFabio Buso\nFabio Buso is VP of Engineering at Hopsworks, leading the Feature Store development team. Fabio holds a master\u2019s degree in Cloud Computing and Services with a focus on data intensive applications.\n\nTill D\u00f6hmen\nTill D\u00f6hmen is a Research Engineer at Hopsworks, where he is contribibuting to the development of Hopswork's Python-centric Feature Store platform. In addition to his work at Hopsworks, he is a guest researcher at the Intelligent Data Engineering Lab of the University of Amsterdam and engages in research at the intersection of data management and machine learning.\n\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
