  "description": "Recommendation systems shape personalized experiences across various sectors, but evaluating their effectiveness remains a significant challenge. Drawing on experiences from industry leaders such as Booking.com, this talk introduces a robust, practical approach to A/B testing for assessing the quality of recommendation systems. The talk is designed for data scientists, statisticians, and business professionals, offering real-world insights and industry tricks on setting up A/B tests, interpreting results, and circumventing common pitfalls. While basic familiarity with recommendation systems and A/B testing is beneficial, it's not a prerequisite.\n\nThis talk aims to provide attendees with a practical understanding of A/B testing in the evaluation of recommendation systems, including unique insights from industry practices and specific tricks that enhance effectiveness.\n\nMy report includes next steps:\n- Introduction to recommendation systems, their ubiquity, and the imperative for evaluation, including industry examples.\n- An overview of A/B testing and its vital role in assessing recommendation systems, supported by insights from Booking.com and other industry leaders.\n- Techniques for designing effective hypotheses for A/B tests, focusing on recommendation systems.\n- Choosing pertinent metrics for robust evaluation of recommendation systems with industry examples.\n- Conducting A/B tests: industry best practices, common pitfalls, and strategies for mitigation, reinforced by real-world cases.\n- Accurate interpretation of A/B testing results and management of statistical biases, with insights from the field.\nBy the end of the talk, attendees will have a comprehensive understanding of how to apply A/B testing effectively to recommendation systems, select relevant metrics, interpret results accurately, and navigate common challenges, backed by industry best practices and practical examples.\n\nBio:\nIldar Safilo\nMachine Learning Scientist in the Booking.com\nExperienced manager in MLE/DS/SE/DA, I possess extensive expertise in machine learning, analytics, and software engineering.
