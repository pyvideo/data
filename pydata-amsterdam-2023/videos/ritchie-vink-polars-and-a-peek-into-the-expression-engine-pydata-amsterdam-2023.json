  "description": "This talk we will see why the expression engine in polars is so versatile and fast.\nWe will look at them in the perspective of the optimizer as well as the physical engine.\n\nPolars expressions are a DSL to a very powerful vectorized engine. They make it very easy to write parallel, efficient and readable code.\n\nThis talk we will see why the expression engine in polars is so versatile and fast.\nWe will look at them in the perspective of the optimizer as well as the physical engine.\n\nBio:\nRitchie Vink\nRitchie Vink is the author of the Polars query engine/ DataFrame library and the CEO/Co-Founder of Polars the company.\nOriginally he has a background in Civil Engineering, but he switched fields and has most work experience in Machine learning and software development. Though what truly matters in experience is what he did in his side-projects.\n\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
