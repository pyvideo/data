During my PhD, I interned as an applied scientist at Amazon Alexa Shopping, where I worked on finding proxies for what customers find relevant when comparing products during their search shopping journey in order to empower Amazon recommendation systems. Before that I obtained a BSc and MSc in Computer Science from the Federal University of Minas Gerais, visited research labs at NYU and the University of Quebec, and worked as a software engineer intern in a news recommendation system start up.\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\nWant to help add timestamps to our YouTube videos to help with discoverability?
