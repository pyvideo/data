  "description": "Harnessing uncertainty: the role of probabilistic time series forecasting in the renewable energy transition\n\nHow can probabilistic forecasting accelerate the renewable energy transition? The rapid growth of non-steerable and intermittent wind and solar power requires accurate forecasts and the ability to plan under uncertainty. In this talk, we will make a case for using probabilistic forecasts over deterministic forecasts. We will cover methods for generating and evaluating probabilistic forecasts, and discuss how probabilistic price and wind power forecasts can be combined to derive optimal short-term power trading strategies.\n\nBio:\nAlexander Backus\nAlexander is Data Science Manager at Dexter Energy, where he is currently leading the development of machine learning-powered short-term power trading optimization products. He brings extensive hands-on machine learning engineering and data science management experience from various industries, including organizations such as KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, ING Bank, Heineken, VodafoneZiggo and IKEA.\n\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
