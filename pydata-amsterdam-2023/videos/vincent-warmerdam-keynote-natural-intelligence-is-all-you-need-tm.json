  "description": "In this talk I will try to show you what might happen if you allow yourself the creative freedom to rethink and reinvent common practices once in a while. As it turns out, in order to do that, natural intelligence is all you need. And we may start needing a lot of it in the near future\n\nI've met a lot of authoritative people in my field who pass out advise that sounds like this:\n\nWorking on recommenders? Collect all the data! Sessions!\nWorking on text classification? That's a solved problem! Bert!\nWorking with embeddings? There's a library for that already!\nWorking on tabular data? XGBoost for the win! GridSearch!\nIn short: \"this is how you do data science, don't go and reinvent the wheel\".\n\nIf you spend 5 minutes thinking about \"the invention of the wheel\" though, then you may start to rethink. After all: the wheels on a bike are different from the wheels on an airplane, just like the wheels of a tractor. And for Pete's sake: that's a good thing! If we hadn't reinvented those wheels, we're be stuck with wooden horse carts.\n\nSo ... what might happen if we take the time to rethink a few things?\n\nSpecifically, this keynote will discuss the following topics:\n\ntext classification\nfraud detection\nproduct recommenders\nactive learning\nembeddings\nI hope you'll join me for some new ideas as well as some live demos.\n\nBio:\nVincent Warmerdam\nVincent D. Warmerdam is a software developer and senior data person. He\u2019s currently works over at Explosion to work on data quality tools for developers. He\u2019s also known for creating calmcode.io as well as a bunch of open source projects. You can check out his blog over at koaning.io to learn more about those.\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
