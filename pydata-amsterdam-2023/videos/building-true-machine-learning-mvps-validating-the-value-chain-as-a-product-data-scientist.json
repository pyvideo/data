  "description": "Some say machine learning projects fail because they live in notebooks.\n\nBut I would bet that even more of them fail because their projects solve a problem that doesn\u2019t exist. Or uses an interface that\u2019s not feasible. In other words, they fail because they don\u2019t validate their underlying assumptions.\n\nProduct analytics helps build models that solve real problems. In my time at ING, I\u2019ve been dealing with a lot of the latter, and I\u2019ll be sharing my thoughts on how to find problems worth solving with data science.\n\nBio:\nAzamat Omuraliev\nAzamat Omuraliev is a Senior Data Scientist at ING. Cracking the problem of personalization since joining ING in 2020! Decided to stay on this topic because it\u2019s a challenge that requires getting many things right: constructing the right kind of machine learning model, staying in touch with customers and handling millions of interactions daily. Thanks to that, still learning something new on the job every single day.\n\nOriginally from Kyrgyzstan, moved to the Netherlands for studies but stayed for friends and for Amsterdam \u2764\ufe0f\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
