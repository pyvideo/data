  "description": "Numerous packages exist within the Python open-source ecosystem for algorithm building and data visualization. However, a significant challenge persists, with over 85% of Data Science Pilots failing to transition to the production stage.\n\nThis talk introduces Taipy, an open-source Python library for front-end and back-end development. It enables Data Scientists and Python Developers to create pilots and production-ready applications for end-users.\n\nIts syntax facilitates the creation of interactive, customizable, and multi-page dashboards with augmented Markdown. Without the need for web development expertise (no CSS or HTML), users can generate highly interactive interfaces.\n\nAdditionally, Taipy is engineered to construct robust and tailored data-driven back-end applications. Intuitive components like pipelines and data flow orchestration empower users to organize and manage data effectively. Taipy also introduces a unique Scenario Management functionality, facilitating \"what-if\" analysis for data scientists and end-users.\n\nDuring this talk, we will showcase the capabilities of Taipy:\n- to create highly-interactive applications easily without any knowledge in web development.\n- to fill a void within the standard Python back-end stack, offering a powerful solution for data-driven applications.\n\nBios:\nFlorian Jacta\n-Specialist of Taipy, a low-code open-source Python package enabling Python developers to develop a production-ready AI application quickly. Package pre-sales and after-sales function.\n-Data Scientist for Groupe Les Mousquetaires (Intermarche) and ATOS.\n-Developed several Predictive Models as part of strategic AI projects.\n-Master in Applied Mathematics from INSA, Major in Data Science and Mathematical Optimization.\n\nAlexandre Sajus\nAlex worked in Amazon Business Intelligence. He graduated with a Master of Engineering at CentraleSup\u00e9lec - Paris-Saclay University and joined Taipy as a Community Success Consultant. His primary skills are MLOps, Machine Learning, Data Engineering, and Python.\n\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
