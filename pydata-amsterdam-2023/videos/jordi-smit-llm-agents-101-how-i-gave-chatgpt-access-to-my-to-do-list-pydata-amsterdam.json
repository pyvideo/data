  "description": "ChatGPT is a fantastic assistant, but it cannot do everything yet. For example, it cannot automatically manage my calendar, update my to-do list, or do anything that requires it to perform actions. However, what would it take to make this a reality? I decided to put it to the test by allowing ChatGPT to manage my to-do list for me.\n\nDuring this presentation, I will tell how I gave ChatGPT access to my to-do list. Along the way, I will introduce you to the concepts behind LLM-based agents and how they work. Of course, I will also give a demo of the final result. After this demo, we will dive into clever engineering solutions and tricks I discovered to solve problems such as handling hallucinations, parsing actions, etc.\n\nThis talk is for people who want to learn how to build their first LLM-based agent. Familiarity with Python, PyDantic, and LMMs is nice during this presentation but not essential. As long as you love overengineered solutions to a basic to-do list, you will like this presentation.\n\nDuring the presentation, we will discuss things such as:\n- How to give ChatGPT access to your ToDo(ist) list?\n- What are LLM agents?\n- What is the REACT framework?\n- A demo of the agent I built to manage my to-do list.\n- Implementation tips and tricks to make the agent work better.\n\nThe repo can be found here:\ngithub.com/j0rd1smit/todoist_react_agent\n\nBio:\nJordi Smit\nHi! My name is Jordi Smit. I\u2019m deeply passionate about software engineering, data science, and automation. Nothing makes me happier than creating software that helps humans by automating a tedious and manual-intensive part of their job. Therefore, I love discussing data science since this field has opened the door to many new kinds of automation. However, data science solutions often stay stuck at the proof of concept level. To combat this issue, you also need software engineering knowledge. That is why I love the intersection between software engineering, data science, and automation.\n\nI work as a Machine Learning Engineer at Xebia Data in Amsterdam. Here, I help companies to transform their ML-based models into production-ready applications. I love this job because it allows me to explore the intersection between software engineering and data science daily.\n\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
