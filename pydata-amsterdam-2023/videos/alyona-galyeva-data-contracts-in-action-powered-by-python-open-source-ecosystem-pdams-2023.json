  "description": "This informative talk aims to close the gap between the theory of data contracts and their real-life implementations. It contains a few Python code snippets and is aimed primarily at data and software engineers. However, it could be food for thought for machine learning engineers, data scientists, and other data consumers.\n\nTopic: There are a lot of ongoing discussions happening about data contracts. I would like to share with you some lessons learned from data contract implementations and show you some Python examples.\n\nAudience: data and software engineers; potentially could be interesting for machine learning engineers, data scientists, and other data consumers. Some affinity with Pandas, Great Expectations, and Open Table Formats are desirable.\n\nType: Informative with some hands-on examples\n\nMain takeaways:\n- better understanding of the data contracts concept\n- tips for batch data contracts implementations\n- tips for streaming data contracts implementations\n\nBio: \nAlyona Galyeva\nAlyona Galyeva is an organizer of PyLadies Amsterdam, co-organizer of MLOps and Crafts, Microsoft AI MVP and Principal Engineer at Thoughtworks\nObserve - Optimize - Learn - Repeat\nPassionate about encouraging others to see different perspectives and constructively break the rules.\nI found my joy in building, optimizing, and deploying end-to-end AI and Data Engineering Solutions.\n\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
