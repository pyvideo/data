  "description": "Pick your next hot LLM prompt using a Bayesian tournament! Get a quick LLM dopamine hit with a side of decision theory vegetables. It's Bayesian Thunderdome: many prompts enter, one prompt leaves.\n\nHow do you chose the best LLM prompt systematically beyond guessing and vibes? Use the winner of a Bayesian tournament! Get a quick dopamine hit from fun LLM prompt magic with a side of Bayesian decision theory vegetables. If you are doing stuff with LLMs \u2014 you'll get a serious tool to improve your prompting game. If you're not using LLMs \u2014 you'll learn about Bayesian tournaments. They are not well known but have wide applicability: they help you optimally choose a winner using a minimal number of matches.\n\nBio:\nAndy Kitchen\nI've helped found multiple start-ups, including CorticalLabs an AI+Biotech company working on \"Synthetic Biological Intelligence\". I've co-authored several papers and patents in deep learning and neuroscience. I've made a mess in more than a dozen programming languages over my career. My stack is full. I've worked on custom neural interface hardware to web apps and everything in between. I've won a few hack-a-thons. I started the Machine Learning and AI meetup in Melbourne Australia, helped found & organize the Compose :: Melbourne conference. I have two cats, I scoop their poop most days.\n\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
