  "description": "# (Talk 1) Stefanie Stoppel & Angelie Kraft: From RGB-D images to complete point clouds\n\nImagine you own a household robot that cleans, cooks and does errands for you. When you tell it to go fetch your favorite coffee mug, the robot not only needs to know what that mug looks like in order to locate it in your apartment, but it should also anticipate its full 3D shape in order to grasp it and bring it to you. We are going to highlight the first steps we took in order to transfer some of these abilities to robotic grasping, by creating an end-to-end Deep Learning pipeline that takes an RGB-D image of an object as input and infers its complete 3D representation in the form of a point cloud.\n\nStefanie is currently pursuing a Master\u2019s degree to become a Machine Learning Engineer. She likes automating ML workflows and cares about bias, fairness & explainability in AI.\n\nAngelie is currently working on her Master's thesis on Bias Mitigation in Natural Language Processing. She is also co-founder of the young start-up AdaLab.ai which provides customers from research and industry with state-of-the-art ML solutions.\n\n-------------------------------------------\nFollow us on Twitter: @PyDataHamburg\n\nPyData is a community for developers and users of open source data tools.
