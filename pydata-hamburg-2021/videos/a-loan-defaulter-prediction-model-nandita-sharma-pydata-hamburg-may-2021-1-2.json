  "description": "In this May Meetup we have two inspiring talks on Machine Learning.\n\nThis edition was sponsored by IBM: IBM funds open source development through NumFocus while Tim Bonnemann provides a brief introduction to the IBM data science community.\n\nPart 2: AutoML with Paco Nathan: https://youtu.be/7oW49Ulr4cY\n\nEnjoy the talks!\nYour PyData Hamburg Crew\n\n--------\n\n# (Talk 1) Nandita Sharma: A Loan Defaulter Prediction Model\n\nIn this talk, Nandita will explain how machine learning techniques play a prominent role in detecting the likelihood of defaulting in advance - by developing an understanding of customers' behavioral patterns before granting a loan. Join this talk to understand how AI helps banks solve and understand their liquidity risk and financial abilities while gaining and retaining current customers.\n\nAbout Nandita: Nandita is Data Scientist and Data Analyst, passionate about AI, neural networks & deep learning. She works at the National College of Ireland as an Assistance Teacher, where she teaches and mentors 80+ students for machine learning projects. In her free time, she loves to learn new things, dancing, painting & baking.\n\n------------\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. 00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
