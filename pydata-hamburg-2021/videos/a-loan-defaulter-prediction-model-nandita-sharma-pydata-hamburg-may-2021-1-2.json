  "description": "In this May Meetup we have two inspiring talks on Machine Learning.\n\nThis edition was sponsored by IBM: IBM funds open source development through NumFocus while Tim Bonnemann provides a brief introduction to the IBM data science community.\n\nPart 2: AutoML with Paco Nathan: https://youtu.be/7oW49Ulr4cY\n\nEnjoy the talks!\nYour PyData Hamburg Crew\n\n--------\n\n# (Talk 1) Nandita Sharma: A Loan Defaulter Prediction Model\n\nIn this talk, Nandita will explain how machine learning techniques play a prominent role in detecting the likelihood of defaulting in advance - by developing an understanding of customers' behavioral patterns before granting a loan. Join this talk to understand how AI helps banks solve and understand their liquidity risk and financial abilities while gaining and retaining current customers.\n\nAbout Nandita: Nandita is Data Scientist and Data Analyst, passionate about AI, neural networks & deep learning. She works at the National College of Ireland as an Assistance Teacher, where she teaches and mentors 80+ students for machine learning projects.
