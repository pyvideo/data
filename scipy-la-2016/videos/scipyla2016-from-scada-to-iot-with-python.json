  "description": "Palestrante: Nahuel Defoss\u00e9\n\nResumo:\n\nThis talk will describe a SCADA system build with Python with an home brew protocol called Mara for a power substation as part of a research and development project in UNPJSB of Trelew city.\n\nWe will describe some of the challenges faced during its development and how they were overcome. Specially non functional requirements such as reliability and low latency (MQTT, AMQP and STOMP).\n\nFinally we will cover how we're iterating over its architecture to provide a more suitable solution for IoT field and how we're using Python at lower levels PlatformIO and how we plan to integrate CIAA (Argentine Open Industrial Computer).",
