  "description": "Palestrante: Paulo Giovani\n\nResumo:\nThe study of plasma oscillations in 3D real systems are usually analyzed from one-dimensional data in the form of time series. In this work we propose a Python tool which will be used to verify the dependencies between canonical time series. The spectral analysis is used to determine the hypothesis of dependence variation of the power spectrum according to the structure of system.",
