  "description": "Palestrante: Fernando Masanori\n\nResumo:\nOne of the biggest differences, in the Python community, in relation to other communities, is its effort to improve diversity. There is even a Diversity Statement at PSF: \"We have created this diversity statement because we believe that a diverse Python community is stronger and more vibrant. A diverse community where people treat each other with respect has more potential contributors and more sources for ideas.\" I was fortunate enough to take part in nine PyCon's in ten different countries: Namibia, UK, Japan, Brazil, Italy, Argentina, Uruguay, Germany, Canada and Spain. Some were not national conferences, but were EuroPython or PyConUS. I always took note of experiences on how to improve diversity, that could be useful and replicable in my local community and would like to share at SciPyLA. There are other reports that I also would like to share, which are only beautiful stories of how Python reaches the most distant people and places you may never have imagined.\n\nMateriais:\n* http://pt.slideshare.net/fmasanori/import-community-62142823",
