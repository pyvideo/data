What if nobody around you cares about making that nasty production data available in a pristine feature store? What if you don't even have time to build out your entire Machine Learning platform?\n\nThere must be a way to still deliver your ML model to users right? There must be way to deliver value.\n\nIn this session, I'll talk about how small teams address the problem of delivering ML-value to users. At a reasonable scale. I'll go over some misconceptions and lessons-learned from 4 years working with early-stage startups.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
