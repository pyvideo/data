It is easy to use, well documented, easy to contribute to, extremely flexible, and extremely slow for large graphs.\nAn upcoming release begins to fix that last issue by calling fast GraphBLAS implementations instead of the native Python implementation.\n\nIf you use NetworkX or have ever written a graph algorithm, this talk will be of interest to you as it shows how NetworkX is planning on a path of pluggable algorithm libraries so users can opt-in to faster implementations with minimal code changes.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
