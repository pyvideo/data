  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) provides a huge variety of economic datasets from different countries. We have explored the Python API for data extraction from the IMF, which allows users (primarily economists or financial analysts) to access the data. The structure of the underlying JSON datasets is quite complex for an unprepared user. In the talk, we will demonstrate the API workflow and go over the issues that we are designing a new, easier-to-use API, which is currently being developed. This is joint work with Dr. Sou-Cheng Choi (Illinois Institute of Technology and SAS Institute Inc.).\n\nThe talk is primarily directed at data analysts and economists interested in utilizing IMF's macroeconomic data.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
