In this session, we explore the integration between Hugging Face and Ray AI Runtime (AIR), allowing users to scale their model training and data loading seamlessly. We will dive deep into the implementation and API and explore how we can use Ray AIR to create an end-to-end Hugging Face workflow, from data ingest through fine-tuning and HPO to inference and serving.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
