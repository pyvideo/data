However, many dashboard solutions come with a caveat \u2013 either the licensing costs, lack of transparency in the workflows, limited creativity, or they cannot be connected to existing infrastructure.\nThis talk is aimed at Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Data Practitioners and Managers struggling with choosing between a myriad of commercial dashboard solutions and DIY. We present how to create your own dashboard using open-source Python technologies like FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and Celery and the challenges involved. We look back at the pitfalls and solutions we have worked on over the past 3 years. The goal is not to present our unique solution, but to show how we can combine different Python libraries to implement custom solutions to solve different use cases. Attendees should be familiar with the basic concepts of web infrastructure. Previous knowledge of any libraries is not required. We hope to provide a starting point to build your custom dashboard solution using open-source tooling.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
