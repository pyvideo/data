Building an ML application is more challenging compared to a traditional application due to the added complexities from models and data in addition to the application code. Using web serving frameworks (e.g. FastAPI) can work for the simple cases but falls short for performance and efficiency. Alternatively, using pre-packaged models servers (e.g. Triton Inference Server) can be ideal for low-latency serving and resource utilization but lacks flexibility in defining custom logic and dependency. BentoML abstracts the complexities by creating separate runtimes for IO-intensive preprocessing logic and compute-intensive model inference logic. Simultaneously, BentoML offers an intuitive and flexible Python-first SDK for defining custom preprocessing logic, orchestrating multi-model inference, and integrating with other frameworks in the MLOps ecosystem.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
