  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nTo develop mature data science, machine learning, and deep learning applications, one must develop a large number of pipeline components, such as data loading, feature extraction, and frequently a multitude of machine learning models.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video! See the description for details.\n\nWant to help add timestamps to our YouTube videos to help with discoverability? Find out more here: https://github.com/numfocus/YouTubeVideoTimestamps",
