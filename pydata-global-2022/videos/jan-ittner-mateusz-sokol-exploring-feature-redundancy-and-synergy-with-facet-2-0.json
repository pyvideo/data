Mistreating or neglecting this aspect can lead to incorrect conclusions and, consequentially, sub-optimal or wrong decisions leading to financial losses or other undesired outcomes. Many common approaches to explain ML models \u2013 as simple as feature importance or more advanced methods such as SHAP \u2013 can yield misleading results if mutual feature dependencies are not taken into account.\n\nIn this talk we present FACET 2.0 - a new approach for global feature explanations using a new technique called SHAP vector projection, open-sourced at: https://github.com/BCG-Gamma/facet/.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
