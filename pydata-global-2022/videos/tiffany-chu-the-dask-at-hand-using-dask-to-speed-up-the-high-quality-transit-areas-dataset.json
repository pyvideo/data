The CA Public Resources Code defines it, but it requires continued access of the General Transit Specification Feed (GTFS) data and fairly complex geospatial processing. The Integrated Travel Project within Caltrans tackles this by leveraging the combined powers of Dask and Python to make this dataset publicly available and updated monthly on the CA open data portal.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
