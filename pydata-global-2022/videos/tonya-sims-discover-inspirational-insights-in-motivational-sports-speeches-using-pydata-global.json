Whether you\u2019re a developer or an athlete, they\u2019ve withstood the journey because even the smartest, the bravest, and the most resilient need some encouragement on occasion.\n\nDuring our time together, we\u2019ll use Python and a speech-to-text provider to transcribe sports podcasts that contain inspirational speeches. We\u2019ll discover insights from the transcripts to determine which ones might give you a boost of energy or rally your team.\n\nWe\u2019ll discover common topics of each sports podcast episode and measure how they leave us feeling: victorious or perhaps overcoming the agony of defeat. We\u2019ll also investigate if there are any similarities and differences in the sports speeches and what makes a great motivational speech that moves people to action.\n\nBy the end, you\u2019ll have a better understanding of using speech recognition in real-world scenarios and using features of Machine Learning with Python to derive insights.\n\nThis talk is for developers of all levels, including beginners.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
