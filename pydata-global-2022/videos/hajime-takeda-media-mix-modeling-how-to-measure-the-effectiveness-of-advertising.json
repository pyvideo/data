Traditionally, regression modeling has been used, but obtaining actionable insights with that approach has been challenging.\n\nRecently, many researchers and data scientists have tackled this problem using Bayesian statistical approaches. For example, Google has published multiple papers about this topic.\n\nIn this talk, I will show the key concepts of a Bayesian approach to MMM, its implementation using Python, and practical tips.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
