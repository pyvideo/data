Snowpark for Python is a new interface for Snowflake warehouses with Pythonic access that enables querying DataFrames without having to use SQL strings, using open-source packages, and running your model without moving your data out of the warehouse. We will discuss the framework and showcase how data scientists can design and train a model end-to-end, upload it to a warehouse and append new predictions using notebooks.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
