But these tools are an odd fit - they schedule tasks, but miss that tasks are built to produce and maintain data assets. They struggle to represent dependencies that are more complex than \u201crun X after Y finishes\u201d and lose the trail on data lineage.\n\nDagster is an open-source framework and orchestrator built to help data practitioners develop, test, and run data pipelines. It takes a declarative approach to data orchestration that starts with defining data assets that are supposed to exist and the upstream data assets that they\u2019re derived from.\n\nAttendees of this session will learn how to develop and maintain data pipelines in a way that makes their datasets and ML models dramatically easier to trust and evolve.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
