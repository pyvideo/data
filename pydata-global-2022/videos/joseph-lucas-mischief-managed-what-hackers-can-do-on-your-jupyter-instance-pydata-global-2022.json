In this presentation, I will introduce the threat model and show why Jupyter instances are valuable targets. Next, I will demonstrate several post-exploitation activities that someone may try to perform on systems hosting Jupyter instances. We will conclude with some defensive strategies to minimize the likelihood and impact of these activities. This talk will help data scientists and information technology professionals better understand the perspective of potential attackers operating in Jupyter environments to improve defensive awareness and behavior.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
