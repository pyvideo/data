  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nMostly, people relate Artificial Intelligence to progress, intelligence and productivity. But with this comes unfair decisions, biases, human workforce being replaced, lack of privacy and security. And to make matters worse, a lot of these problems are specific to AI. This indicates that the rules and regulations in place are inadequate to deal with them. Responsible AI comes into play in this situation. It seeks to resolve these problems and establish AI system responsibility. In this talk I am going to talk about What is Responsible AI, Why is it needed, How it can be implemented, What are the various frameworks for Responsible AI and What is the Future?\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
