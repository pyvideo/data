We often know where the research journey starts but have uncertainty about how and WHEN it ends.\n\nIn this talk, I will share my own experience leading algorithmic teams through the cycle of research into the production of live-streaming AI products. I will also share how to mitigate between agile incremental delivery and giant leaps forward that require longer research. How understanding the minimum viable product (MVP) way of thinking can help not only managers but every developer. Learn to outline MVP for new AI capabilities, and move forward with production in mind, while always raising the quality standards. At the end of this session, you will get the boost you need to take the data-driven experimental mindset to the next level, spiced with methodologies you can adapt to development as well as research.\n\nWhy is the process of transforming research into a \u201creal world\u201d product so full of question marks?

PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
