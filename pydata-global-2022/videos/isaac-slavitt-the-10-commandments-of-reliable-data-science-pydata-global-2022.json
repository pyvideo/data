  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nData science as a professional discipline is still in its infancy, and our field lacks widespread technical norms around project organization, collaboration, and reproducibility. This is painful both for practitioners and their end users because disorganized analysis is bad analysis, and bad analysis costs money and wastes time. This talk presents ten principles for correct and reproducible data science inheriting from software engineering\u2019s seven decades of hard-earned lessons as well as numerous experiences with data science teams at organizations of all sizes. We motivate these principles by looking at some hard truths about data science \u201cin the wild.\u201d\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
