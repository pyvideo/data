It combines memory mapping, lazy evaluations, efficient C++ algorithms, and a variety of other tricks to empower your off-the-shelf laptop and make it crunch through a billion samples in real time.\n\nA common use-case for Vaex is as a backend for data apps, especially if one needs to process, transform, and visualize a larger amount of data in real time. Vaex implements a number of features that have been specifically designed to improve performance of data hungry dashboards or apps, namely:\n- caching\n- async evaluations\n- early stopping of operations\n- progress bars\n\nIn this talk we will showcase how you can use these features to build efficient dashboards and data apps, regardless of the data app library you prefer using.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
