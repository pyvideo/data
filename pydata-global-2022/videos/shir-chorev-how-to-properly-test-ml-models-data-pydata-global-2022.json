Part of the executed code is a model that was dynamically trained on a fresh batch of data, and silent failures are common. Therefore, it\u2019s problematic to use known methodologies such as automating tests for predefined edge cases and tracking code coverage.\nIn this talk we\u2019ll discuss common pitfalls with ML models, and cover best practices for automatically validating them: What should be tested in these pipelines? How can we verify that they'll behave as we expect once in production?\nWe\u2019ll demonstrate how to automate tests for these scenarios and introduce a few open-source testing tools that can aid the process.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
