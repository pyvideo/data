In this talk, we show how domain experts can create text classifiers without writing a single line of code through the open-source, no-code Label Sleuth system (www.label-sleuth.org); a system that combines an intuitive labeling UI with active learning techniques and integrated model training functionality. Finally, we describe how the system can also benefit more technical users, such as data scientists, and developers, who can customize it for more advanced usage.\n\nWhat is the problem and who is the target audience?\n\n\u2022 Domain experts that want to create text classifiers but lack ML knowledge.\n\u2022 More technical users, incl. researchers, data analysts, and developers who want to accelerate development of text classifiers.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
