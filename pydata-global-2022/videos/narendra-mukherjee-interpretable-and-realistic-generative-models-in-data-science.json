  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nAre you fascinated by the real-life images or text produced by deep generative models but cannot interpret their underlying data generation process or see how they can be applied to other problems? I will talk about generative simulations built using knowledge of the problem domain that can produce realistic data in a variety of scenarios. This talk will be a Bayesian thinking exercise cum data science case study of product star rating timeseries from an online marketplace (like Amazon.com) \u2013 I will show how we use recent advances in likelihood-free Bayesian inference together with a detailed simulation of an online marketplace to directly infer factors involved in how customers purchase and rate products.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
