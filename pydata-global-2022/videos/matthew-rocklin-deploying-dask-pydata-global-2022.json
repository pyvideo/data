  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nDask is a framework for parallel computing in Python.\nIt's great, until you need to set it up.\n\nKubernetes? Cloud? HPC? SSH? YARN/Hadoop even?\nWhat's the right deployment technology to choose?\n\nAfter you set it up a new set of problems arise:\n\nHow do you install software across the cluster?\nHow do you secure network access?\nHow do you access secure data that needs credentials?\nHow do you track who uses it and constrain costs?\nWhen things break, how do you track them down?\nThere exist solutions to these problems in open source packages like dask-kubernetes, helm charts, dask-cloudprovider, and dask-gateway, as well as commercially supported products like Coiled, Saturn, QHub, AWS EMR, and GCP Dataproc. How do we choose?\n\nThis talk describes the problem faced by people trying to deploy any distributed computing system, and tries to construct a framework to help them make decisions on how to deploy.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
