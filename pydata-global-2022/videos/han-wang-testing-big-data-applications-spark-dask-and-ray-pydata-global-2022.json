  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nData practitioners use distributed computing frameworks such as Spark, Dask, and Ray to work with big data. One of the major pain points of these frameworks is testability. For testing simple code changes, users have to spin up local clusters, which have a high overhead. In some cases, code dependencies force testing against a cluster. Because testing on big data is hard, it becomes easy for practitioners to avoid testing entirely. In this talk, we\u2019ll show best practices for testing big data applications. By using Fugue to decouple logic and execution, we can bring more tests locally and make it easier for data practitioners to test with low overhead.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
