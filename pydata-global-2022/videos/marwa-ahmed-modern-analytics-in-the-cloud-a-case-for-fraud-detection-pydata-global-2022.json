Despite this, it can be unclear and sometimes confusing to know how cloud services can be used to replicate your existing analytical solutions in the Cloud or even how services can fit together to build new solutions.\nThe goal of this talk is to help answer these two questions. First by explaining what modern analytics look like in cloud environments and then by presenting a live use case for building an end-to-end analytical solution in the context of fraud detection for E-commerce businesses.\n\nThis talk will assume knowledge in some areas, such as the Hadoop ecosystem and the main tools used such as Airflow, Kafka, Spark, etc. an overall idea will be more than sufficient and some experience with building and deploying machine learning models (some MLOps experience). Therefore, the target audience would be data scientists/engineers with 4-5 years of experience working in analytics and/or architects looking to move their analytics solutions to the Cloud but are still unsure how it can fit together.\n\nAt the end of the talk, the audience will have a clear understanding of how modern analytics can be performed in the cloud and what a typical modern data architecture looks like. In the context of AWS, the audience will also have an understanding of the AWS analytics service offerings and what services can be used for/tailored to their needs. Finally, the audience will gain a clearer idea of how they can leverage ML capabilities to build a full pipeline in the cloud while cutting their development time by half.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
