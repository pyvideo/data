While JupyterLab has been embraced by many, there are still many active users of Jupyter Notebook. With that in mind, Jupyter developers have been gearing up for the release of the updated Notebook 7 based on JupyterLab components as outlined in the Jupyter Enhancement Proposal #79. With this, there are significant changes coming to Notebook 6, of which the upcoming Notebook 6.5 is intended to be end-of-life, and users installing Notebook will soon receive a version of the project that may disrupt their workflows. In an effort to give users time to transition to using the updated codebase, the NbClassic project has been introduced. NbClassic is the Jupyter Server extension implementation of the classical notebook. NbClassic has also become the owner of the static assets for the classical notebook, and Notebook 6.5 depends on NbClassic to provide those.\nThe aim of this talk is to:\n1. Reflect on the changes to the Jupyter ecosystem with the introduction of NbClassic and Notebook 7.\n2. Address some questions that may come up about NbClassic and Notebook 6.5, as well as some of those that may come up once Notebook 7 is released.\n3. Showcase the feasibility with which users can use the different front-ends NbClassic, Notebook 7 and JupyterLab with a demo.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
