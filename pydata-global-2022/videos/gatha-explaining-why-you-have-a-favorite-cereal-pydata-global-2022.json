Now surely, if we modeled the consumer ratings for cereals, some features would be considered more important than others. After all, feature engineering is one of the most critical steps in modeling. But after the model is up and running, what if we tweak the features just to see how much meddling can affect the preference? This process is called post-hoc feature attribution and it seeks to interpret the model behavior. In this talk, let us spoon through the interpretability of ML models.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
