One of the known limitations in pandas is that it does not scale with your data volume linearly due to single-machine processing.\nPandas API on Spark overcomes the limitation, enabling users to work with large datasets by leveraging Apache Spark. In this talk, we will introduce Pandas API on Spark and help you scale your existing data science workloads using that. Furthermore, we will share the cutting-edge features in Pandas API on Spark.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
