  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nFor enterprises to adopt and embrace AI into their transformational journey, it is imperative to build Trustworthy AI- so that AI products and solutions that are built, delivered, and acquired are responsible enough to drive trust and wider adoption. We look at AI Trust as a function of 4 key constructs which include Reliability, Safety, Transparency, Responsibility and Accountability. These core constructs are pillars of driving AI trust in our products and solutions. In this talk, I will explain how to enable each core construct and will articulate how they can be measured in some real-world use cases.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
