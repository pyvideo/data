  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nModel training is a time-consuming, data-intensive, and resource-hungry phase in machine learning, with much use of storage, CPUs, and GPUs. The data access pattern in training requires frequent I/O of a massive number of small files, such as images and audio files. With the advancement of distributed training in the cloud, it is challenging to maintain the I/O throughput to keep expensive GPUs highly utilized without waiting for access to data. The unique data access patterns and I/O challenges associated with model training compared to traditional data analytics necessitate a change in the architecture of your data platform.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
