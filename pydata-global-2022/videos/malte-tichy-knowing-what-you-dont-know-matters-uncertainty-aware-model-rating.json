Business evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error, a priori, neglect that unavoidable uncertainty. This talk discusses why and how to account for uncertainty when evaluating models using traditional business metrics, using python standard tooling. The resulting uncertainty-aware model rating satisfies the requirements of statisticians because it accounts for the probabilistic process that generates the target. It should please practitioners because it is based on established business metrics. It appeases executives because it allows concrete quantitative goals and non-defensive judgements.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
