Undershooting on campaign viewability objectives means spending money on ads that nobody watches, while overshooting them can mean vastly reducing the available ad slots. At JW Player, we combine predictive models with PID controllers to tune decision thresholds and deliver the maximum possible reach to our advertisers while hitting their goals.\n\nFor video advertisers, precisely hitting their ad performance goals is critical.

PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
