  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nIntroducing a new project, Compute over Data (Bacalhau), to run any computation on decentralized data. No need to move large datasets & all languages/data are supported. If you can run Docker/WASM, you're in the game!\nBacalhau is a decentralized public computation network that takes a job and moves it near where the data stored, including across a decentralized server network that stores data and runs jobs inside it. Bacalhau runs the job near where data lives and eliminates data management for the user.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
