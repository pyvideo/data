We developed Modin, a scalable, drop-in alternative to pandas, that preserves the dynamic and flexible behavior of pandas dataframes while enhancing the scalability.\n\nThis talk will walk you through our team\u2019s research at UC Berkeley, which enabled the development of Modin. We\u2019ll also discuss our latest publication at VLDB, which covers a novel approach to parallelization and metadata management techniques for dataframes.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
