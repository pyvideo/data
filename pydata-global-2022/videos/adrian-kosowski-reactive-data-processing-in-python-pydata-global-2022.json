But there is a downside: model decisions can't be easily changed later when the model is updated with fresher data, user feedback, or freshly tuned hyperparameters. This is often a blocker for anomaly detection, recommender systems, process mining, and human-in-the-loop planning.\n\nTo deal with this, we'll demonstrate design patterns to easily express reactive data processing logic. We will use Pathway, a scalable data processing framework built around a Python programming interface. Pathway is battle-tested with operational data in enterprise, including graphs and event streams in real-world supply chains, and is now launching as open-core.\n\nYou will leave the talk with a thorough understanding of the practical engineering challenges behind reactive data processing with a Machine Learning angle to it, and the steps needed to overcome these challenges.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
