We present two projects that provide native support for Awkward Arrays in the broader PyData ecosystem. In dask-awkward we have implemented a new Dask collection to scale up and distribute workflows with partitioned Awkward Arrays. In awkward-pandas we have implemented a new Pandas extension array type, making it easy to use Awkward Arrays in Pandas workflows and enabling massive acceleration in the processing of nested data. We will show how these projects plug into PyData and present some compelling use cases.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
