  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nThe virtual chemical universe is expanding rapidly as open access titan databases Enamine Database (20 Billion), Zinc Database (2 Billion), PubMed Database (68 Million) and cheminformatic tools\nto process, manipulate, and derive new compound structures are being established. We present our open source knowledge graph, Global-Chem, written in python to distribute dictionaries of common chemical lists of relevant to different sub-communities out to the general public i.e What is inside Food? Cannabis? Sex Products? Chemical Weapons? Narcotics? Medical Therapeutics?\n\nTo navigate new chemical space we use our data as a reference index as to help us keep track of common patterns of interest and help us explore new chemicals that could be theoretically real. In our talk, we will present the chemical data, the rules governing the data and it's integrity, and how to use our tools to understand the chemical universe with python.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
