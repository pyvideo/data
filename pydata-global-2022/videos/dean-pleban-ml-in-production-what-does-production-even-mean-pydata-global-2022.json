  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nWe like talking about production \u2013 one famous, but probably wrong statement about it is \u201c87% of data science projects never make it to production\u201d.\n\nWhile giving a talk to a group of up-and-coming data scientists, a question that surprised me came up:\n\nWhen you say \u201cproduction\u201d, what exactly do you mean?\n\nBuzzwords are great, but all the cool kids know what production is, right? Wrong.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll define what production actually means. I\u2019ll present a first-principles, step-by-step approach to thinking about deploying a model to production. We\u2019ll talk about challenges you might face in each step, and provide further reading if you want to dive deeper into each one.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
