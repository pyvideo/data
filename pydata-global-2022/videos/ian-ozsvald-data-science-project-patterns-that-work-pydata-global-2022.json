Really hard.\nI'll present patterns that work for these 5 critical project stages. This guidance is based on 15 years of experience writing AI and DS solutions and 5 years giving both strategic guidance training on how to get to success.\nYou'll come away from the session with new techniques to help your team deliver successfully and increase their confidence in the roadmap, new thoughts on how to diagnose your model's quality and new ideas to make positive difference in your organisation.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
