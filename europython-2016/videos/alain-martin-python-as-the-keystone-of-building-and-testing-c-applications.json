  "description": "Alain Martin - Python as the keystone of building and testing C++ applications\n[EuroPython 2016]\n[18 July 2016]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n(https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/python-as-the-keystone-of-building-and-testing-c-applications)\n\nThis talk explains how Ableton\u2019s developers use Python to build and\ntest C, C++ and Objective-C code. Our \"build-system\" is a collection\nof Python scripts that simplify our workflows, and help us write\nbetter software. The top-level scripts share a common design which\nmakes them easy to use, maintain and extend. This talk describes the\nessence of that design, so you can apply it to your own project.\n\n-----\n\nAt Ableton, we make Live_, Push_ and Link_, unique\nsoftware and hardware for music creation and performance. Live is a\nC++ desktop application built from a 15-year old code base. Push is an\ninstrument embedding a multicolor display which renders a `Qt Quick`_ \nscene powered by Qt_. Link is a technology that keeps\nmusic devices in time and is available to app developers as\nLinkKit_, an iOS SDK. \"But what does all that have to do with\nPython?\", you might ask.\n\nThis talk answers that question by explaining how our developers use\nPython to build and test C, C++ and Objective-C source code. Based on\nGYP_, what we call \"build-system\" is a collection of Python\nscripts that simplify our workflows, and help us write better\nsoftware. The three top-level scripts, \"configure.py\", \"build.py\" and\n\"run.py\", share a common design which makes them easy to use by\ndevelopers, as well as easy to maintain and extend. This talk\ndescribes the essence of that design, so you can apply it to your own\nproject.\n\n.. _Live: https://www.ableton.com/live/\n.. _Push: https://www.ableton.com/push/\n.. _Link: https://www.ableton.com/link/\n.. _`Qt Quick`: https://www.qt.io/qt-quick/\n.. _Qt: http://www.qt.io/\n.. _LinkKit: https://ableton.github.io/linkkit/\n.. _GYP: https://gyp.gsrc.io/",
