This\nunfortunately doesn\u2019t scale well and tens of successive network calls\nwill make your endpoints painfully slow.\n\nOne solution is to parallelize these network calls. If you are already\nusing an asynchronous web app (such as Tornado or Twisted), more\nasynchronous in your asynchronous shouldn\u2019t be much of a challenge.\nBut if you chose not to dive into the madness of chained Deferred\ncalls, and used a standard prefork/threaded WSGI web server (such as\nGunicorn or uWSGI) to run your Django/Flask/Pyramid application, you\nmight find yourself wondering how to manage these asynchronous calls.\n\nThis talk will explore different solutions (running Twisted event\nloop, Co-Routines, Asyncio, \u2026) and how well they play with the\ndifferent parallelization models of WSGI web servers.",
