It will\ncover implementation, challenges and further steps. The project is\nstill a work in progress at the time of proposal and the code is\n`available on GitHub`_. It was inspired by the `Over-the-Air Audio Identification talk`_ at FOSDEM 2016.\n\nThe basic structure of the project consists a classifier that\nfingerprints audio and stores it in a searchable form and a recogniser\nthat fingerprints a smaller chunk of audio and then searches the\nstored records to find the most suitable fit for it. The recogniser\nwill be exposed as an API to allow for different front-ends.\n\nI will aim to introduce both the field of DSP and concepts behind\napplications like Shazam in a simple easy-to-understand manner. The\naudience will not need any prior experience in anything except Python.\n\n.. _`available on GitHub`: https://github.com/notexactlyawe/abracadabra\n.. _`Over-the-Air Audio Identification talk`: https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/audio_identification/",
