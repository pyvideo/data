Comparing the two, probably the highest cost\nthat we see is with the interest.\nAs our code base grows and our deadlines get tougher we tend to\nforget about the cost our project will have to pay for every\nfunctionality that we implement in a hurry, for which we \u201cforget\u201d\nabout tests or for which we write in a comment \u201cthis needs to be\nrefactored\u201d or \u201cthis is a temporary solution. refactor later\u201d.\nWhat qualifies as debt? What qualifies as interest? How do we manage\nit? At what levels in our projects can we see the debt and the\ninterest? Is it really unavoidable?",
