  "description": "The OpenGL api is one of the oldest (and most used) graphics library\nin both the gaming and simulations world. In latest years the api has\nbeen extremely re-designed to support modern hardware features\navailable in GPUs.\nCan we build realtime graphics application with Python using OpenGL ?\nWell, obviously Yes !\n\n-----\n\nThe talk will introduce how  2D and 3D graphics works, which math is\nrequired for mastering them and why strong hardware cooperation and\nheavy optimizations have been required since the very beginning of\ngaming development history.\n\nOnce the theory is \"almost\" clear, we can start talking about OpenGL,\nwhich problems tries to solve and how it evolved in more than 20\nyears.\n\nThe last (and the biggest) part of the talk will show how to interface\nPython with OpenGL, how to draw simple 2D sprites and how to load and\nshow 3D models using simple lighting models.\n\nWarning: OpenGL shaders (the custom code you upload in the GPU) are\nwritten in GLSL, a pseudo-c dialect, so expect a bit of lower-level\nprogramming",
