They both can be run relatively\nfast on a development machine and can give fast feedback to the\ndeveloper, preventing many kinds of problems.\n\nService tests run the whole application process without any internal\nmodifications, but have to present the service with a fake \"outside\nworld\". I'll show how to fake external HTTP services with Mountebank\n(similar to WireMock). Instead of faking other systems (like\ndatabases) we can quickly spin up the real deal as a Docker container\nfrom within the tests.\n\nContract tests check if the contract (interface) of your service with\nthe outside world is kept, so no external services should be broken by\nthe changes you are introducing. It can also work the other way\naround, proving that your collaborators are keeping their part of the\ndeal. In both cases, Swagger (a RESTful API description scheme) and a\nfew clever tricks can be used for significant advantage.",
