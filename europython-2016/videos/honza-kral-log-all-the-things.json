I would like to show you how you can make sense of all that\ndata, how to collect and clean them, store them in a scalable fashion\nand, finally, explore and search across various systems.\n\n-----\n\nCentralized logging (and the ELK stack) is proving itself to be a very\nuseful tool in managing a production infrastructure. When combined\nwith other data sources (application logging, business data, ...) it\ncan provide even more insight.\n\nThis talk is an introduction into the area with some overview of the\nmotivation, tools and techniques that can prove useful. We will show\nhow the open source ELK (Elasticsearch Logstash and Kibana) stack can\nbe used to implement this.\n\nIt is geared towards people familiar with the DevOps concept that are\nlooking to improve their lives by introducing smarter tools.",
