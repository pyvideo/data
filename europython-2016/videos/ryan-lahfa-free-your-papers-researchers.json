What can we do as developers? Well, we can\nhelp researchers to open their papers!\n\n-----\n\nAnd of course, how do we do it?\n\nPython, of course! Dissemin is a website using the Django framework\nwhich aims to promote a global Open Access policy, it offers to\nresearchers a way to deposit legally their papers inside of a\nrepository (Zenodo for example).\n\nWe will see how the researcher world works quickly, and what are the\nchallenges of assisting researcher to make papers available to\neveryone!",
