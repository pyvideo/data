On September 14, 2015, the Laser\nInterferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) finally observed\nthe gravitational wave signature from the merger of two black holes.\nThis detection marks the dawn of a new age of _gravitational wave\nastronomy_, where we routinely hear the sounds emanating from deep\nwithin the most energetic events in the Universe.  This talk will\ncover the events leading up to one of the most important discoveries\nof the last century, and the myriad of ways in which Python enabled\nthe effort.",
