Present the COBRE dataset and show its characteristics.\n2. Use nibabel to open a NifTI file and see the matrix/volume parameters.\n3. Use nilearn.plotting to show the anatomical image.\n4. Use nipy to co-register the anatomical image to the fMRI image.\n5. Use nilearn to perform CanICA and plot ICA spatial segmentations.\n\nIf time allows:\n\n7. Present a brain anatomical atlas and its template.\n8. Present the tools needed for non-linear registration.\n9. Show the result of an atlas-based segmentation result.\n10. Use nilearn to calculate the resting-state functional connectivity matrix of the subject.\n11. Plot it with Bokeh.",
