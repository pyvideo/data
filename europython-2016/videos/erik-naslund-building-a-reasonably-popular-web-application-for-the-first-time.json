They would\nhave made our life so much easier!\n\n- Log and monitor from day one.\n- Have a way to profile your API calls.\n- Things will fail, be sure you know when they do.\n- Have a way to keep secrets.\n- Everything needs a limit (even if it's really big).\n-  Be wary of hitting data type limits.\n- Don't get too attached to a framework.\n- Choose components which allow language interoperability.\n- Horizontally scalable everything.\n- Plan for database downtime.\n- Features are a great way to test things out before launching them to the public.\n- Have a way to share settings between back end and front end.\n- Have a way to enter maintenance mode.\n- Require different quality of code for different parts of your application.",
