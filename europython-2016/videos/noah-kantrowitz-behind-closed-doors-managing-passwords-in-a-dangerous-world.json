Fortunately a new wave of tools are\nemerging to help manage, update, and audit these secrets. Come learn\nhow to avoid being the next TechCrunch headline.\n\n-----\n\nSecrets come in many forms, passwords, keys, tokens. All crucial for\nthe operation of an application, but each dangerous in its own way. In\nthe past, many of us have pasted those secrets in to a text file and\nmoved on, but in a world of config automation and ephemeral\nmicroservices these patterns are leaving our data at greater risk than\never before.\n\nNew tools, products, and libraries are being released all the time to\ntry to cope with this massive rise in threats, both new and old-but-\nignored. This talk will cover the major types of secrets in a normal\nweb application, how to model their security properties, what tools\nare best for each situation, and how to use them with major web\nframeworks.",
