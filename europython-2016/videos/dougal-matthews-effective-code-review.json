However, research has shown that\nthe main benefits of code reviews are; knowledge transfer, team\nawareness and finding alternative solutions.\n\nCode reviews when done well are more than just finding defects; it\nshould be a discussion and conversation with other developers about\nfinding the best solutions. We will talk about re-framing code review\nto encourage open discussions.\n\n-----\n\nThis talk is for everyone that is already involved in regular code\nreview and those hoping to start. I will talk through the code review\nprocess with the aim of making it a better and more useful experience\nfor both the authors and the reviewers.\n\nThe talk will follow the following rough outline:\n\n- Introduction\n- Why do code reviews\n- What are we aiming to get out of it\n- Submitting code for review\n- How can you help reviewers?\n- What should you avoid doing?\n- Removing ownership of the code\n- Reviewing code\n- How should you give feedback?\n- What should you look for?\n- How can you encourage people to review more?\n- How to avoid and remove bike-shedding\n- Code review tools and how they impact on the process.\n- Wrap up and conclusion",
