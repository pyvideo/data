What can Python community learn from it and how are\nwe different?\n\n-----\n\nHaskell community has been living in \"Cabal hell\" for decades, but\nStack tool and Nix language have been a great game changer for Haskell\nin 2015.\n\nPython packaging has evolved since they very beginning of distutils in\n1999. We'll take a look what Haskell community has been doing in their\nplayground and what they've done better or worse.\n\nThe talk is inspired by Peter Simons talk given at Nix conference:\n[Peter Simons: Inside of the Nixpkgs Haskell Infrastructure][1]\n\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDnZsBxqeBM&list=PL_IxoDz1Nq2Y7mIxMZ28mVtjRbbnlVdmy&index=4\n\nOutline:\n\n- Cabal (packaging) interesting features overview\n- Cabal file specification overview\n- Interesting Cabal features not seen in Python packaging\n- Lack of features (introduction into next section)\n- Cabal hell\n- Quick overview of Haskell community frustration over Cabal tooling\n- Stack tool overview\n- What problem Stack solves\n- How Stack works\n- Comparing Stack to pip requirements\n- Using Nix language to automate packaging\n- how packaging is automated for Haskell\n- how it could be done for Python",
