In\nparticular within the Python community, we've seen some engineers\nmoving their stack from Python to Go or starting their new project in\nGo. This talk is **not** about whether you should move from Python to\nGo. Instead, this talk is for those who've been hearing all about all\nthe hype but haven't yet had a chance to take a proper look at Go.\n\nWe'll first _very_ briefly look at Go and Python's history. Then we'll\ngo through a high-level side-by-side walkthrough of basic Go syntax\nand semantics compared to Python. Finally, we'll have a brief look at\na subset of the ecosystem and tools available to Go and Python\nprogrammers for certain tasks such as testing, code formatting,\ndocumentation generation etc.\n\nBy the end, you will not be a Go programmer but you'll have a high-\nlevel feel for how the Go language operates.",
