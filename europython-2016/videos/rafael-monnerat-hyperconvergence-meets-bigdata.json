Written in 100% in Python,  SlapOS and Wendelin, can create a\ncomplete Big Data Infraestruture with out-of-core capabilities ready\nto use and operate in just few hours.\n\n[1]: http://www.wedelin.io\n[2]: http://community.slapos.org\n\n-----\n\nThis presentation aims to demonstrate how to use [SlapOS][1]\n(Hyperconverged OS) to deploy an entire Big Data Infrastrucure and\nshow how \"data life cycle\" can be managed with [Wendelin][2] -\ncovering ingestion, analysis, visualization and weaving it into an\napplication.\n\nWe'll show how Wendelin and SlapOS could handle acquisition, analysis\nand exploitation of data, making it a potential solution for IOT\nscenarios where data is available and needs some logic applied before\nbeing presented as web application, possibly on a commercial basis.\n\nThe agenda of the presentation includes an introduction on SlapOS, as\na tool used to deploy a wide range of different services and an\nintroduction of Wendelin, as a tool in order to make out-of-core\npython applications.\n\nAfter a short introduction, we progress to show the steps to deploy\nSlapOS infrastructure and later to deploy Wendelin on the just\ndeployed SlapOS, including an use case which shows SlapOS deploying a\nfluentd instance to ingest data to the Wendelin Database.\n\nTo conclude, we make a live demo with an Jupiter using out-of-core\npython to handle wav files stored on Wendelin, and a second short demo\non handle computer resources consumption data.\n\n[1]: http://community.slapos.org\n[2]: http://www.wendelin.io/",
