  "description": "\"Learning from Low Rank Tensor Data  A Random Tensor Theory Perspective\"\nMohamed El Amine Seddik, Malik Tiomoko, Alexis Decurninge, Maxime Guillaud, Maxim Panov\n(https://proceedings.mlr.press/v216/seddik23a.html)\n\nAbstract\nUnder a simplified data model, this paper provides a theoretical analysis of learning from data that have an underlying low-rank tensor structure in both supervised and unsupervised settings. For the supervised setting, we provide an analysis of a Ridge classifier (with high regularization parameter) with and without knowledge of the low-rank structure of the data. Our results quantify analytically the gain in misclassification errors achieved by exploiting the low-rank structure for denoising purposes, as opposed to treating data as mere vectors. We further provide a similar analysis in the context of clustering, thereby quantifying the exact performance gap between tensor methods and standard approaches which treat data as simple vectors.\n\nSlides: https://www.auai.org/uai2023/oral_slides/432-oral-slides.pdf",
