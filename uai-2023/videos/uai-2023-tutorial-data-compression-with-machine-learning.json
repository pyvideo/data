  "description": "Data Compression With Machine Learning \n Karen Ullrich, Yibo Yang, Stephan Man \n The efficient communication of information is an application with enormous societal and environmental impact, and stands to benefit from the machine learning revolution seen in other fields. Through this tutorial, we hope to disseminate the ideas of information theory and compression to a broad audience, overview the core methodologies in learning-based compression (i.e., neural compression), and present the relevant technical challenges and open problems defining a new frontier for probabilistic machine learning.",
