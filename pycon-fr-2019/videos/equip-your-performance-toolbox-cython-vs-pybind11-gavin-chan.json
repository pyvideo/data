  "description": "Developing Python applications is handy and rapid, but performance is always concerned, especially on the CPU bound components. We'll first go through the common tools and tricks which may surprise you on the performance improvement, and compare the two prevailing tools, Cython and Pybind11. Finally, their similarity and difference, in terms of implementation and performance, will be listed out so that attendees can thoroughly understand the criteria to choose the right library in their projects.",
