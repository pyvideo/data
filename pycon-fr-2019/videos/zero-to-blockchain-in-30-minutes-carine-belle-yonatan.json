  "description": "We will build a working blockchain with all the basic functionality, and deploy our own currency, pyconCoin - from scratch.\n\nLet\u2019s take a complicated topic, break it up into simple building blocks, and connect the dots in our favorite way - by implementing them in Python.\n\nIt's incredibly cool to see how easy it is to create things that sound relatively complex.\n\nNo understanding in blockchain is needed for this talk.",
