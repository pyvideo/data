  "description": "Over the years, we have flooded the Internet with information and opinions about everything.\nWe are at the point where it is impossible to read everything about a subject.\nThe purpose of this talk is to demonstrate how we can build a text processing pipeline to extract information by reading website pages.\nWe will go through the conception of a text processing pipeline to detect relationships between Fictional Characters of any show.\nThe goal is to be able to remember the characters and their relationships before the release of the next season without having to binge-watch all the seasons again.",
