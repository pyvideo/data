An individual could gauge if he\u2019s being underpaid or overpaid. Top management could have a quick, summarized and transparent feedback from their employees. A company could discover about its competitors strengths and weaknesses.\n\nAttendees will learn how to scrape numerical and text data (reviews) from online websites and transform into structured data. Analyze trends and aggregate numerical data at different levels to form the big picture about the company. However, compiling text is a powerful means to understand details and also sentiment of employees.

Finally, we will delve into simpler methods that are more apt than ML algorithms for this problem statement.",
