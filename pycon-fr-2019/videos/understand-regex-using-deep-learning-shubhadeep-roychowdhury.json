  "description": "\u201cSome people, when confronted with a problem, think \u201cI know, I\u2019ll use regular expressions.\u201d Now they have two problems.\u201d - Jamie Zawinski\n\nI was staring to my screen and there was this \u2014 `^(http|https|ftp):[\\/]{2}([a-zA-Z0-9\\-\\.]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4})(:[0-9]+)?\\/?([a-zA-Z0-9\\-\\._\\?\\,\\'\\/\\\\\\+&amp;%\\$#\\=~]*)` \nI could understand that it is, may be, talking about some kind of URL pattern. But what the meaning of it? No answer. And Stackoverflow was no help.\n\n\nThis when I started my project to automatically generate the intent of any RegEx expression given the expression itself. Without any prior domain knowledge.\nI will walk you through the data I used, how I built my models, and the outcomes achieved.\nI will also provide a notebook so you\u2019ll be able to play with it.",
