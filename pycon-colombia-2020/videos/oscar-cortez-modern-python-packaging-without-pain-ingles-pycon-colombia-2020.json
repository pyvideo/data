It saves you time for writing the same code multiple times, it helps organize code in a modular way and enables leveraging other smart people’s work to make new things happen. When it comes to Python, unfortunately the term “package” is an overloaded term, as it means both a noun for a namespace that you put modules into as well as the verb of bundling up some code for easy distribution. Historically, Python packaging has been a source of significant pain for even the most devoted Python enthusiasts.\n\nIn this talk I’ll be covering all the required instructions and a quick overview of the current state of Python packaging tools. I’ll mostly focus on setuptools, pip and wheels, putting an emphasis on their superiority over their precursors. I’ll also list down the honorable mentions of tools worth knowing. Then I’ll share examples of how you can use the features of the Setuptools library, we’ll go from nothing to a package that you can proudly put it in your portfolio to be used by other people.\n\nAnd yeah! Without pain!\n\n\nWe want to say thanks to all our sponsors who helped make the conference a huge success.\n\n- Universidad EAFIT - http://www.eafit.edu.co/\n- Globant - https://www.globant.com/\n- Linode - https://www.linode.com/\n- Mercadolibre.com - https://www.mercadolibre.com.co/\n- monoku.com - https://monoku.com/\n- Playvox - https://www.playvox.com/\n- UruIT - https://uruit.com/\n- Elastic - https://www.elastic.co/es/\n- #The_Python_Software_Foundation - https://www.python.org/\n- Monadical - https://monadical.com/\n- Fluid Attacks - https://fluidattacks.com/\n- Swapps - https://swapps.com/\n- TributiOnline - https://www.tributi.com/\n- VanHack - https://vanhack.com/\n- Avanet - http://avanet.org/\n- Cafeto Software - https://cafeto.co/\n- OmniBnk - https://omnibnk.com/\n- AutonomicMind - https://autonomicmind.com/\n- #AIFund - https://aifund.ai/  \n\nFollow us\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pyconcolombia\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconcolombia\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/pyconcolombia/\nTelegram: https://t.me/pyconcolombia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pycon-colombia/\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/pyconcolombia/\n\nMore About PyCon Colombia in http://www.pycon.co",
