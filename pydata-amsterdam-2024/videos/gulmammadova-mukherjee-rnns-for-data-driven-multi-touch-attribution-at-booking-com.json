Or, do you wonder about language models and their application to other sequence modelling tasks? This talk will introduce the field of marketing attribution modelling and show that language/sequence models (like attention-based RNNs) can be modified to function as flexible attribution models. In the course of the talk, we will use our work at Booking.com to illustrate the challenges involved in such re-purposing of language models to attribution, esp. in the evaluation of these models in the absence of \u201cground truth\u201d signals.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
