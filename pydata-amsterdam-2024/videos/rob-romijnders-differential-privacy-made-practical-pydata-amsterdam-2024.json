Differential Privacy (DP) is a popular way to quantify privacy loss and has been adopted in many applications. Examples include the Android keyboard learning about user typing, Apple\u2019s system to collect statistics on emoticons and website usage, and the US government releasing Census population statistics. We\u2019ll discuss in this talk an intuitive and tangible definition of differential privacy and how the above examples implement DP. In an IPython notebook, we'll demonstrate the effects of Differential Privacy on a small-scale data science problem. Additionally, I\u2019ll refer to Python repos for doing differential privacy at scale, including for deep learning.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
