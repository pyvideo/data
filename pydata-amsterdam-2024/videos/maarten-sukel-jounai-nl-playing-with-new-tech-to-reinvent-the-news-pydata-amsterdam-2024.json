The idea was simple: work with different tech than usual, combine it with what works, and perhaps: use generative AI to innovate news consumption in a responsible way. We ended with a free to use website with multiple automated AI generated podcasts every day, with references to sources and always up to date news articles and more.\n\nIn this talk, I will take you along in the exciting process of experimenting with new technologies and the lessons learned along the way. From comparing 'old-school' machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to what I call \u2018API ML\u2019, to changing to Azure while being used to working with AWS, and switching from Python to Java for web services because why not try\u2014I'll share it all. Hint: Wil likely build them in Python again in the future. Why? Will discuss during the talk! We'll also look at how Vue.js measures up against its brother Nuxt.js for front-end development. This talk isn't just about creating an AI generated news website\u2014it's about continuous learning, staying curious, and keeping your mind sharp by embracing new challenges.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
