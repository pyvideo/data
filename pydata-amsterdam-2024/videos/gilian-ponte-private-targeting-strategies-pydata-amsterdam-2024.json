In response, policymakers have recently imposed bans on targeting due to its privacy invasive nature (e.g., Meta). In this talk, we introduce two private targeting strategies that we prove to satisfy differential privacy: a mathematical definition of privacy. These two private targeting strategies allow analysts to target customers while simultaneously establish a level of privacy risk. We first introduce \"Private Causal Neural Networks\" (PCNNs), which estimate the causal or incremental effect of a targeting intervention. The second strategy involves the randomization of the targeting decision. In two increasingly complex simulation studies, we benchmark the two private targeting strategies to accurately learn the population average treatment effect, conditional average treatment effect (i.e., CATE), and its targeting profitability. In a field experiment with over 400,00 customers, we empirically apply the privacy protection strategies and visualize the inherent trade-off between privacy risk and profitability.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
