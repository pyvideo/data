  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nThis is the story of a fun idea that turned into a huge benchmark before it turned into a rabbit hole.\n\nI was trying to figure out reasonable default parameters for some of the components in the skrub library. In order to do that I was looking for datasets with a permissible license which I could use for benchmarking. This is how I stumbled on some old Kaggle competitions that still had their datasets publicly available. So I should just run a simple benchmark, right?\n\nThat's where it all started. There were many lessons. They will all be shared.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
