  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nData scientists and app developers today must deal with data coming from different regions around the world. Whether handling signup form data, scraping news articles, or building LLM pipelines, one of the most common types of unstructured text data seen today are names of people and addresses; however, conventions for how these are written are completely different depending on their country of origin. In this talk, intended for data scientists and non-technical stakeholders alike, I will provide an introduction to what these types of data can look like, a number of misconceptions about what they do or don't contain, and some examples for how to work with them.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
