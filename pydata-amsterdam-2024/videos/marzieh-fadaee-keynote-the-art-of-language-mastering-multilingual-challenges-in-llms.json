The ability to understand and generate text in multiple languages has expanded the capabilities of these models, making them more versatile and accessible to a global audience. In this talk we explore the current landscape of multilingual LLMs, addressing the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. The discussion will cover critical topics such as the scarcity of multilingual datasets, the evaluation and benchmarking of multilingual models, and the unique safety considerations when dealing with diverse languages.\n\nAdditionally, the talk will highlight the challenges and gains of the global open science efforts, such as Aya and Global Exams, to build state of the art multilingual models and resources. Finally, we discuss the unexplored areas in multilingual NLP, providing insights into potential future research directions and the ongoing efforts to enhance the performance and applicability of LLMs.\n\nMarzieh Fadaee is a senior research scientist at Cohere For AI, a non-profit research lab that seeks to solve complex machine learning problems and create more points of entry into machine learning research. Marzieh's work is broadly interested in all aspects of natural language understanding, particularly in multilingual learning, data-conscious learning, robust and scalable models, compositionality, and interpretability. Previously she was the NLP/ML research lead at Zeta Alpha Vector working on smarter ways to discover and organize knowledge. She did her PhD at University of Amsterdam, working on developing models to understand and utilize interesting phenomena in the data.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
