  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nIn the domain of data science, a significant number of questions are aimed at understanding and quantifying the effects of interventions, such as assessing the efficacy of a vaccine or the impact of price adjustments on the sales volume of a product. Traditional association based machine learning methods, predominantly utilized for predictive analytics, prove inadequate for answering these causal questions from observational data, necessitating the use of causal inference methodologies. This talk aims to introduce the audience to the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) framework for causal inference. The presentation has two main objectives: firstly, to provide an insight into the types of questions where causal inference methods can be applied; and secondly, to demonstrate a walkthrough of causal analysis on a real dataset, highlighting the various steps of causal analysis and showcasing the use of the pgmpy package.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
