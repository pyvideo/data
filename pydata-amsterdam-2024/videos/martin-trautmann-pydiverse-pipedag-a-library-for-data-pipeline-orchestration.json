It allows users to focus on their actual tasks: Writing analytics and data transformation code in pandas, polars, sqlalchemy, ibis, and the like.\n\nThe talk is meant for people working with data pipelines on beginner to advanced level. It teaches best practices in dealing with code versioning vs. data versioning, working with small data samples during development, and how to gradually improve the coding style of an existing pipeline.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
