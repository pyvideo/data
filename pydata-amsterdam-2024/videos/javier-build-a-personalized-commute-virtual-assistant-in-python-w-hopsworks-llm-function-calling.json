While timekeepers are better at planning and sticking to the plan, time optimists somehow believe that time is malleable and extends the closer the deadline. Nevertheless, whether you are an organized timekeeper or a creative timebender, external factors can affect your commute.\n\nIn this talk, we will define the different components necessary to build a personalized commute virtual assistant in Python. The assistant will help you analyze your historical lateness records, estimate future delays, and suggest the best time to leave home based on these predictions. It will be powered by a LLM and will use a technique called Function Calling to recognize the user intent from the conversation history.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
