The easy way out - switching from a modular approach to a single unified optimization model - is often not feasible though. In this talk, I will discuss and demonstrate the implementation of an alternative method that will allow ML models to consider potential behavior of other components in a complex system using regret-sensitive loss functions. By using a simple game-theoretical formalization of the system and quantifying regret (i.e., the experience of a sub-optimal decision when information about the best action comes available after the model was already called), we can widen the optimization scope of the model and increase the overall performance of complex decision processes.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
