Randomized experiments, as the golden standard method for effect estimation, are often not practical. Alternative solutions use observational (non-experimental) data, while they introduce their own challenges, which will be addressed in this talk. These challenges are often not elaborately discussed in text books and can be summarized as follows: 1) samples from treatment group are not available all at once and could become available throughout time (online data stream), 2) appropriate control groups are not immediately available for comparison with the treatment group, and 3) the outcomes of choice in causal effect estimation should be in line with the business questions and accepted KPI\u2019s in the domain.\n\nThis self-contained talk targets generic data scientists by presenting the theory of causal effect estimation in a simplified and visual (little-math) fashion. In addition, technical & business requirements, lessons learned from e-commerce & banking, and results are shared when it comes to applying causal effect estimation in practice.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
