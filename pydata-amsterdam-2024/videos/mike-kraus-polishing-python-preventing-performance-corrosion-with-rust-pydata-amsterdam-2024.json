  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nPython is beloved for its simplicity and versatility, but it can struggle with performance in compute-intensive tasks. Rust, on the other hand, offers high performance and memory safety. This talk will explain how you can harness the power of Rust to enhance Python modules using the PyO3 library.\n\nWe will explore this through a practical example: a pure Python payment handler and an optimized version where its functionality is abstracted away using Rust. This approach will demonstrate how to overcome performance bottlenecks while retaining the ease of use and flexibility that Python offers. However, like any tool, it comes with its own considerations and trade-offs.\n\nThis talk is particularly interesting for Machine Learning Engineers and Python developers seeking to boost the performance of their applications.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
