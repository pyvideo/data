  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nEver wondered how to start from scratch, without any existing data infrastructure? In this talk, I will share my experience of building a data platform from scratch at a startup. This talk is intended for data (platform) engineers, data scientists, and anyone interested in building a scalable data platform in the cloud using open-source tools.\n\nI will discuss the challenges faced in designing and implementing this platform, as well as the lessons learned along the way. We'll answer questions such as, why build a data platform at a startup? Why pick open source over alternatives? How to deploy data infrastructure on Kubernetes? How to build the first data products?\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
