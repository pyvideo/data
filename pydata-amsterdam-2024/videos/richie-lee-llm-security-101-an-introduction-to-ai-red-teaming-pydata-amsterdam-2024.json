Following Microsoft's best practices, this hands-on session is tailored to data scientists who acknowledge the need to secure Gen AI systems, but simply do not know how (yet). Attendees will learn to assess and mitigate LLM risks, observe a live penetration testing demo, and gain practical steps to embark on their own AI security journeys.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
