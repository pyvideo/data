This talk will explore how synthetic data is changing problem-solving in markets with data scarcity, drawing from my experience in the African market, particularly in Kenya.\nI will demonstrate how synthetic data has been utilized to develop models for proactive healthcare solutions.\nThe methodologies and lessons learned from these applications provide valuable insights that could inspire approaches in other markets, including Europe.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
