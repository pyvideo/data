We will focus on the three main steps of the Flow: Performance monitoring, Root Cause Analysis, and Issue resolution. In the performance monitoring part, we will cover the two core algorithms that allow us to estimate the predictive performance without ground truth: Confidence-Based Performance Estimation (CBPE) and Direct Loss Estimation (DLE). The Root Cause Analysis part will go over various Drift Detection algorithms, focusing especially on multivariate drift detection and linking the drop in performance to drift signals. In the issue resolution part, we will briefly cover the typical steps to fix ML failure and their applicability and limitations.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
