  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\ndbt (Data Build Tool) is a great framework for creating, building, organizing, testing and documenting data models, i.e. data sets living in a database or a data warehouse. Through a declarative approach, it allows data practitioners to build data with a methodology inspired by software development practices.\n\nThis leads to data models being bundled with a lot of metadata, such as documentation, data tests, access control information, column types and constraints, 3rd party integrations... Not to mention any other metadata that organizations need, fully supported through the meta parameter.\n\nAt scale, with hundreds or thousands of data models, all this metadata can become confusing, disparate, and inconsistent. It's hard to enforce good practices and maintain them in continuous integration systems. We introduce in this presentation a linter we have built: dbt-score. It allows data teams to programmatically define and enforce metadata rules, in an easy and scalable manner.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
