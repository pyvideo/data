This July it has hit the 1.0 milestone and this August it has landed GPU support.\n\nThe 1.0 milestone has made the Polars team confident about the API going forward and now they want to expand on the functionality. This talk will go through what has been done pre 1.0 and what to expect after. 1.0 has cemented the API and set the constraints for the future other engines the Polars team is working on.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
