  "description": "Discover metalearners, a cutting-edge Python library designed for Causal Inference with particularly flexible and user-friendly MetaLearner implementations. metalearners leverages the power of conventional Machine Learning estimators and molds them into causal treatment effect estimators. \n\nThis talk is targeted towards data professionals with some Python and Machine Learning competences, guiding them to optimizing interventions such as 'Which potential customers should receive a voucher to optimally allocate a voucher budget?' or 'Which patients should receive which medical treatment?' based on causal interpretations.\n\nKevin Klein and Francesc Mart\u00ed Escofet are Data Scientists from QuantCo.\n\nhttps://github.com/kklein/pdp24-metalearners/blob/main/slides/slides.pdf\nhttps://github.com/Quantco/metalearners\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
