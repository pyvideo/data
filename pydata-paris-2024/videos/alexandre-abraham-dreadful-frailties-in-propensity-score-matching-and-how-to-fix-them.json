  "description": "In their seminal paper \"\"Why propensity scores should not be used for matching,\"\" King and Nielsen (2019) highlighted the shortcomings of Propensity Score Matching (PSM). Despite these concerns, PSM remains prevalent in mitigating selection bias across numerous retrospective medical studies each year and continues to be endorsed by health authorities. Guidelines to mitigating these issues have been proposed, but many researchers encounter difficulties in both adhering to these guidelines and in thoroughly documenting the entire process.\n\nIn this presentation, I show the inherent variability in outcomes resulting from the commonly accepted validation condition of Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) below 10%. This variability can significantly impact treatment comparisons, potentially leading to misleading conclusions. To address this issue, I introduce A2A, a novel metric computed on a task specifically designed for the problem at hand. By integrating A2A with SMD, our approach substantially reduces the variability of predicted Average Treatment Effects (ATE) by up to 90% across validated matching techniques.\n\nThese findings collectively enhance the reliability of PSM outcomes and lay the groundwork for a comprehensive automated bias correction procedure. Additionally, to facilitate seamless adoption across programming languages, I have integrated these methods into \"\"popmatch,\"\" a Python package that not only incorporates these techniques but also offers a convenient Python interface for R's MatchIt methods.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
