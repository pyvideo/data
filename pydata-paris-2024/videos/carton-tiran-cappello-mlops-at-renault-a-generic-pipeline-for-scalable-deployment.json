  "description": "Scaling machine learning at large organizations like Renault Group presents unique challenges, in terms of scales, legal requirements, and diversity of use cases. Data scientists require streamlined workflows and automated processes to efficiently deploy models into production. We present an MLOps pipeline based on python Kubeflow and GCP Vertex AI API designed specifically for this purpose. It enables data scientists to focus on code development for pre-processing, training, evaluation, and prediction. This MLOPS pipeline is a cornerstone of the AI@Scale program, which aims to roll out AI across the Group.\n\nWe choose a Python-first approach, allowing Data scientists to focus purely on writing preprocessing or ML oriented Python code, also allowing data retrieval through SQL queries. The pipeline addresses key questions such as prediction type (batch or API), model versioning, resource allocation, drift monitoring, and alert generation. It favors faster time to market with automated deployment and infrastructure management. Although we encountered pitfalls and design difficulties, that we will discuss during the presentation, this pipeline integrates with a CI/CD process, ensuring efficient and automated model deployment and serving.\n\nFinally, this MLOps solution empowers Renault data scientists to seamlessly translate innovative models into production, and smoothen the development of scalable, and impactful AI-driven solutions.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
