  "description": "NetworkX is arguably the most popular graph analytics library available today, but one of its greatest strengths - the pure-python implementation - is also possibly its biggest weakness.  If you're a seasoned data scientists or a new student of the fascinating field of graph analytics, you're probably familiar with NetworkX and interested in how to make this extremely easy-to-use library powerful enough to handle realistically large graph workflows that often exceed the limitations of its pure-python implementation.\n\nThis talk will describe a relatively new capability of NetworkX; support for accelerated backends, and how they can benefit NetworkX users by allowing it to finally be both easy to use and fast. Through the use of backends, NetworkX can also be incorporated into workflows that take advantage of similar accelerators, such as Accelerated Pandas (cudf.pandas), to finally make these easy to use solutions scale to larger problems.\n\nAttend this talk to learn about how you can leverage the various backends available to NetworkX today to seamlessly run graph analytics on GPUs, use GraphBLAS implementations, and more, all without leaving the comfort and convenience of the most popular graph analytics library available.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
