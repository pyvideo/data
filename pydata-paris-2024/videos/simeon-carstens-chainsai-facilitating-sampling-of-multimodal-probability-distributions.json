  "description": "Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, a class of iterative algorithms that allow sampling almost arbitrary probability distributions, have become increasingly popular and accessible to statisticians and scientists. But they run into difficulties when applied to multimodal probability distributions. These occur, for example, in Bayesian data analysis, when multiple regions in the parameter space explain the data equally well or when some parameters are redundant. Inaccurate sampling then results in incomplete and misleading parameter estimates.\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, a very popular class of iterative algorithms that allow sampling almost arbitrary probability distributions, run into difficulties when applied to multimodal probability distributions. These occur, for example, in Bayesian data analysis, when multiple regions in the parameter space explain the data equally well or when some parameters are redundant.\nIn this talk, intended for data scientists and statisticians with basic knowledge of MCMC and probabilistic programming, I present Chainsail, an open-source web service written entirely in Python. It implements Replica Exchange, an advanced MCMC method designed specifically to improve sampling of multimodal distributions.\nChainsail makes this algorithm easily accessible to users of probabilistic programming libraries by automatically tuning important parameters and exploiting easy on-demand provisioning of the (increased) computing resources necessary for running Replica Exchange.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
