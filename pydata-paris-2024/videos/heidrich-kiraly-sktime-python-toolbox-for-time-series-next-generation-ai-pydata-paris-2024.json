  "description": "sktime is a widely used scikit-learn compatible library for learning with time series. sktime is easily extensible by anyone, and interoperable with the pydata/numfocus stack. \n\nThis talk presents progress, challenges, and newest features off the press, in extending the sktime framework to deep learning and foundation models.\n\nRecent progress in generative AI and deep learning is leading to an ever-exploding number of popular \u201cnext generation AI\u201d models for time series tasks like forecasting, classification, segmentation.\n\nParticular challenges of the new AI ecosystem are inconsistent formal interfaces, different deep learning backends, vendor specific APIs and architectures which do not match sklearn-like patterns well \u2013 every practitioner who has tried to use at least two such models at the same time (outside sktime) will have their individual painful memories.\n\nWe show how sktime brings its unified interface architecture for time series modelling to the brave new AI frontier, using novel design patterns building on ideas from hugging face and scikit-learn, to provide modular, extensible building blocks with a simple specification language.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
