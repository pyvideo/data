  "description": "Rising concerns over IT's carbon footprint necessitate tools that gauge and mitigate these impacts. This session introduces CodeCarbon, an open-source tool that estimates computing's carbon emissions by measuring energy use across hardware components. Aimed at AI researchers and data scientists, CodeCarbon provides actionable insights into the environmental costs of computational projects, supporting efforts towards sustainability without requiring deep technical expertise.\n\nThis talk from the main contributors of Code Carbon will cover the environmental impact of IT, the possibilities to estimate it and a demo of CodeCarbon.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7245529358763724803/\nhttps://github.com/mlco2/codecarbon\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
