  "description": "The expanding Apache Arrow universe - standardizing and accelerating tabular data access and interchange\n\nApache Arrow has become a de-facto standard for efficient in-memory columnar data representation. Beyond the standardized and language-independent columnar memory format for tabular data, the Apache Arrow project also has a growing set of supplementary specifications and language implementations. This talk will give an overview of the recent developments in the Apache Arrow ecosystem, including ADBC, nanoarrow, new data types, and the Arrow PyCapsule protocol.\n\nhttps://jorisvandenbossche.github.io/talks/2024_PyDataParis_Arrow/#1\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
