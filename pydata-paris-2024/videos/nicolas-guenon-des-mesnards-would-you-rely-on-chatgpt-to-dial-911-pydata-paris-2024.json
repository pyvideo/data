  "description": "Would you rely on ChatGPT to dial 911? A talk on balancing determinism and probabilism in production machine learning systems\n\nIn the last year there hasn\u2019t been a day that passed without us hearing about a new generative AI innovation that will enhance some aspect of our lives. On a number of tasks large probabilistic systems are now outperforming humans, or at least they do so \u201con average\u201d. \u201cOn average\u201d means most of the time, but in many real life scenarios \u201caverage\u201d performance is not enough: we need correctness ALL of the time, for example when you ask the system to dial 911. \n\nIn this talk we will explore the synergy between deterministic and probabilistic models to enhance the robustness and controllability of machine learning systems. Tailored for ML engineers, data scientists, and researchers, the presentation delves into the necessity of using both deterministic algorithms and probabilistic model types across various ML systems, from straightforward classification to advanced Generative AI models. \n\nYou will learn about the unique advantages each paradigm offers and gain insights into how to most effectively combine them for optimal performance in real-world applications. I will walk you through my past and current experiences in working with simple and complex NLP models, and show you what kind of pitfalls, shortcuts, and tricks are possible to deliver models that are both competent and reliable.\n\nThe session will be structured into a brief introduction to both model types, followed by case studies in classification and generative AI, concluding with a Q&A segment.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
