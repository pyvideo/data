  "description": "Building scalable ETL pipelines and deploying them in the cloud can seem daunting. It shouldn't be. Leveraging proper technologies can make this process easy. We will discuss the whole process of developing a composable and scalable ETL pipeline centred around Dask that is fully built with Open Source tools and how we can deploy to the cloud.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
