  "description": "For some natural language processing (NLP) tasks, based on your production constraints, a simpler custom model can be a good contender to off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs), as long as you have enough qualitative data to build it. The stumbling block being how to obtain such data? Going over some practical cases, we will see how we can leverage the help of LLMs during this phase of an NLP project. How can it help us select the data to work on, or (pre)annotate it? Which model is suitable for which task? What are common pitfalls and where should you put your efforts and focus?\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
