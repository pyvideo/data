  "description": "Transformers are everywhere: NLP, Computer Vision, sound generation and even protein-folding. Why not in forecasting? After all, what ChatGPT does is predicting the next word. Why this architecture isn't state-of-the-art in the time series domain?\n\nIn this talk, you will understand **how Amazon Chronos and Salesforece's Moirai transformer-based forecasting models work**, the **datasets used to train them** and **how to evaluate them** to see if they are a good fit for your use-case.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
