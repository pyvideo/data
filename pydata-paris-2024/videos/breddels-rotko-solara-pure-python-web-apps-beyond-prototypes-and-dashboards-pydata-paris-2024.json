  "description": "Many Python frameworks are suitable for creating basic dashboards or prototypes but struggle with more complex ones. Taking lessons from the JavaScript community, the experts on building UI\u2019s, we created a new framework called Solara. Solara scales to much more complex apps and compute-intensive dashboards. Built on the Jupyter stack, Solara apps and its reusable components run in the Jupyter notebook and on its own production quality server based on Starlette/FastAPI.\n\nSolara has a declarative API that is designed for dynamic and complex UIs yet is easy to write. Reactive variables power our state management, which automatically triggers rerenders. Our component-centric architecture stimulates code reusability, and hot reloading promotes efficient workflows. With our rich set of UI and data-focused components, Solara spans the entire spectrum from rapid prototyping to robust, complex dashboards.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12Y4YJlJ_YC2DWiYvIZljySwSMPqE9oFuHF_YQxMBFEg/edit#slide=id.g303f45a6bba_0_0\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
