  "description": "This talk introduces [DataLab](https://datalab-platform.com), a unique open-source platform for signal and image processing, seamlessly integrating scientific and industrial applications.\n\nThe main objective of this talk is to show how [DataLab](https://datalab-platform.com) may be used as a complementary tool alongside with Jupyter notebooks or an IDE (e.g., [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)), and how it can be extended with custom Python scripts or applications.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
