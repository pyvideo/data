  "description": "Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) is emerging as a powerful addition to traditional vector search retrieval methods. Graphs are great at representing and storing heterogeneous and interconnected information in a structured manner, effortlessly capturing complex relationships and attributes across different data types. Using open weights LLMs removes the dependency on an external LLM provider while retaining complete control over the data flows and how the data is being shared and stored. In this talk, we construct and leverage the structured nature of graph databases, which organize data as nodes and relationships, to enhance the depth and contextuality of retrieved information to enhance RAG-based applications with open weights LLMs. We will show these capabilities with a demo.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\nhttps://alonsosilvaallende.github.io/2024-PyData-Paris/#/title-slide\nhttps://github.com/alonsosilvaallende/2024-PyData-Paris/blob/main/PyData-Paris.ipynb\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
