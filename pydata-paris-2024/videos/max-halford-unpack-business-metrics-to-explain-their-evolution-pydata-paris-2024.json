  "description": "One of the more mundane tasks in the business analytics world is to measure KPIs: averages, sums, ratios, etc. Typically, these are measured period over period, to see how they trend. If you're a data analyst, you've likely been asked to debug/explain a metric, because a stakeholder wants to understand why a number has changed.\n\nThis topic isn't well grounded theory, and the answers we come up with can be lacklustre. In this talk, we discuss solutions to this very common topic. We will look at a methodology we have developed at Carbonfact, and the opensource Python tool we are sharing.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
