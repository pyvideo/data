  "description": "In the past few years, web-based engineering software has been steadily gaining momentum over traditional desktop-based applications. It represents a significant shift in how engineers access, collaborate, and utilize software tools for design, analysis, and simulation tasks. However, converting desktop-based applications to web applications presents considerable challenges, especially in translating the functionality of desktop interfaces to the web. It requires careful planning and design expertise to ensure intuitive navigation and responsiveness.\n\nJupyterLab provides a flexible, interactive environment for scientific computing. Despite its popularity among data scientists and researchers, the full potential of JupyterLab as a platform for building scientific web applications has yet to be realized.\n\nIn this talk, we will explore how its modular architecture and extensive ecosystem facilitate the seamless integration of components for diverse functionalities: from rich user interfaces, accessibility, and real-time collaboration to cloud deployment options. To illustrate the platform's capabilities, we will demo JupyterCAD, a parametric 3D modeler built on top of JupyterLab components.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
