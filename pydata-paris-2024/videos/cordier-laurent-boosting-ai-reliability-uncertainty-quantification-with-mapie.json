  "description": "MAPIE (Model Agnostic Prediction Interval Estimator) is your go-to solution for managing uncertainties and risks in machine learning models. This Python library, nestled within scikit-learn-contrib, offers a way to calculate prediction intervals with controlled coverage rates for regression, classification, and even time series analysis. But it doesn't stop there - MAPIE can also be used to handle more complex tasks like multi-label classification and semantic segmentation in computer vision, ensuring probabilistic guarantees on crucial metrics like recall and precision. MAPIE can be integrated with any model - whether it's scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch. Join us as we delve into the world of conformal predictions and how to quickly manage your uncertainties using MAPIE.\n\nLink to Github: https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/MAPIE\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
