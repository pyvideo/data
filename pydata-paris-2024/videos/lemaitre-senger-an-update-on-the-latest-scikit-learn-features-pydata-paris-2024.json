  "description": "In this talk, we provide an update on the latest `scikit-learn` features that have been implemented in versions 1.4 and 1.5. We will particularly discuss the following features:\n\n- the metadata routing API allowing to pass metadata around estimators;\n- the `TunedThresholdClassifierCV` allowing to tuned operational decision through custom metric;\n- better support for categorical features and missing values;\n- interoperability of array and dataframe.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
