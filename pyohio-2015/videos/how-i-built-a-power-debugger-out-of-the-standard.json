  "description": "Smiley spys on your application, recording everything it does, using\nPython's built-in tracing facility and a database to create a complete\nrecord of your program's runtime so you can study it. Most of the tools\nI used to create Smiley are in Python's standard library, and the\nhistory of Smiley's development serves as a framework to discuss those\ntools and how you can tap their power yourself.\n",
