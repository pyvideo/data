  "description": "**Supervised learning, machine learning, classifiers!** *Help?* In this\ntalk I define a problem, identifying an email as spam, from the\nperspective of a beginner and show how Python can help us learn to\nclassify. We will translate knowing spam \"when I see it\" into a basic\nmodel and use a Naive Bayes classifier to determine if email is spam. We\nwill train our classifier with examples and practice!\n",
