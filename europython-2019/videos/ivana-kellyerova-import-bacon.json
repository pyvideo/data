  "description": "\"import bacon \ud83e\udd53\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-12 - PyCharm]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Ivana Kellyerova\n\nIt's often said that Python comes with batteries included, meaning that the standard library can do basically anything except for maybe conjure bacon for you (though I heard that's coming in 3.8). I don't think we fully appreciate the sheer vastness of it, though, so I went through it module by module looking for hidden gems (sorry, eggs). This is a by no means exhaustive compilation of the useful, the underrated, and the funny.\n\nWhen it comes to the Python standard library, chances are you use it on a daily basis -- or more likely, a more or less stable subset of it. The usual way we add things to the subset is by looking for a solution to a problem and ending up getting pointed to a standard library module. That, however, means that the odds of you finding out that there is a whole module whose sole purpose is to tell you if a string is a Python keyword are very slim.\n\nThe aim of this talk is to showcase CPython libraries that are interesting in some way: mostly for their usefulness, but in some cases simply for being wonderfully weird in some way. The talk is not aimed at any particular level of Python experience - as a beginner you'll get a taste of just how many batteries Python ships with, and as a person using the language often you might end up growing your own personal subset a bit more.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
