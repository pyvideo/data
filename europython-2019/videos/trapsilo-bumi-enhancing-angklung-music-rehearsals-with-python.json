  "description": "\"Enhancing Angklung Music Rehearsals with Python\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-12 - Shanghai]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Trapsilo Bumi\n\nAngklung is a traditional musical instrument from Indonesia. This instrument has a lot of variety in how it is performed; a common format is the orchestral format in which 15-30 players gather to form a team. Playing Angklung in this way is fun but also presents some challenges that are hard to solve manually.\n\nFirst, I will introduce you to the instrument and how it works/how it is played. Then, I will show you how Python-based algorithms can be used to ease the pains of managing Angklung teams, by reading Angklung-specific sheet music and calculating the most optimal distribution of Angklung based on several important factors.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
