  "description": "\"status quo of virtual environments\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-12 - MongoDB]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Bernat Gabor\n\nPython is easy to learn and use programming language; however, managing dependencies and package versions for it are nowhere as pleasant. One of the basic building block created to help with this is virtual environments. Join me in understanding how virtual environments work from within (by one of the project maintainers); also, to find out if the good old virtualenv project has any place left, now that Python 3.4+ contains venv.\n\nThis talk is aimed to be a bit more technical in its first parts, presenting in technical details what a virtualenv is. The target audience is anyone who used virtual environments and wants to understand how they tick from within. I\u2019ll also emphasise diversity and inclusion at Python interpreter level by highlighting other interpreters than CPython: Jython, PyPy or Iron Python. A concise outline goes as follows:\n\nWhat is a virtual environment?\n- why we need it\n- what we use it for\n- demo - virtualenv vs system env\nHow do we build a virtual environment (CPython)\n- technical workflow of venv creation\n- activation\n-- bash\n-- powershell\n-- cmd.bat\nOther interpreters\n- why other than CPython?\n- PyPy\n- Jython\n- virtualenv\n- all Python support\n- extra activation - xonosh\nSummary and q/a\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
