  "description": "Understanding the control flows in programs can be simple but\nincreasingly difficult once the program becomes more complex. Debugging\nthese programs can become problematic even worse with a meager amount of\ntest coverage. So what to do? Increasing test coverage can cost you\nquite a lot of time and may not necessarily yield better results.\n\nUsing slicing as a technique for debugging programs aids to understand\ncontrol flow better. A slice is a subset of the program which affects\nthe values of the point of interest, also known as a slicing criterion.\nUsing program slicing, reasoning about your code will become much\nquicker and easier as you can safely ignore any not relevant parts of\nthe program.\n\nThis talk is about building a slicing tool for Python and the journey to\nthis solution.\n",
