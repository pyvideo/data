Well, there\u2019s no\nbetter way to do so than breaking the software they\u2019re using.\n\nIn this talk, I\u2019ll walk you through very good ways to do so by showing\nexamples taken from experience - because experience is the only thing\nthat matters (TM) - so that you\u2019ll be able, by the time this talk ends,\nto do the same to your users.\n\n(P.S: If you\u2019ve a kinder hearth, you can also do the exact opposite of\nwhat I\u2019ll say and keep your users happy.)\n",
