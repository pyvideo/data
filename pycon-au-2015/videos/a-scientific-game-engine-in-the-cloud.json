  "description": "Azrael is a game engine for engineers. Unlike traditional engines it\nemphasises accurate physics, runs in the Cloud, offers a language\nagnostic API, and is written in (mostly) Python.\n\nIts main purpose is to make it easy for engineers to build, study, and\ncontrol complex physical systems, for instance how to auto pilot a space\nship; or a fleet thereof; in formation; through an Asteroid belt...\n\nI will show a live demo to illustrate the concept. It uses a simple\ncontrol algorithm to manoeuvre an object to a pre defined position in\nspace. Once there it will maintain that position despite random\ncollisions with other objects.\n\nFor more information and demo videos please visit\nhttps://olitheolix.com/azrael. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/olitheolix/azrael.\n",
