  "description": "Bayesian models are often more useful than classical statistical models\nwhen dealing with data concerning rare events in small populations. For\nexample, if you are looking at the number of cancer diagnoses in a local\ngovernment area, Bayesian models allow you to combine the individual and\npopulation level data to produce more reliable estimates.\n\nFitting these models can be both complex and computationally expensive,\nso we need it to be fast. Some of the datasets we deal with are\nextremely big, and the need for both tweaking and regular update cycles\nmeans we need to re-run the models frequently.\n\nBut beauty is also crucial. We need the package to be easy to code and\ndescribe, so that the statisticians and scientists we work with can\nbuild, maintain and understand their own models without needing to refer\nto programmers. We don\u2019t want a statistical black box.\n\nFinally, we need it to be easy. Easy to fit into our systems;\ntechnology-agnostic so we can change systems; and automatable so that\nthe regular work of updating models with new data can happen \u2018hands\noff\u2019.\n\nThere are a number of Bayesian modelling packages available, but how do\nyou know which one to use? This talk will take you through the positives\nand negatives of the major packages, focusing on the specifics of my\nwork in health statistics, as well as providing a general overview of\nwhat these packages can do.\n",
