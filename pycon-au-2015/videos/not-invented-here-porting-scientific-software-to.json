  "description": "Are you a scientist who's can't get work done because you the tools you\nneed aren't available? Do your collaborators use a different computing\nplatform to you? Are you struggling to find anyone who can help you\nsolve your software integration problems?\n\nThese challenges occur because scientists face some of the most\ndifficult challenges in computing - dealing new and diverse problems;\nworking with prototypes and legacy systems; collaborating with domain\nexperts, rather than software experts; all while delivering on time with\nminimal resources.\n\nPython has a reputation for being a language that excels at \"glueing\"\ndifferent systems together in a style that is both easy to understand,\ntest and maintain. More importantly using Python is one way to make sure\nthat you spend your time working on research, rather than coding and\ndebugging.\n\nThis presentation will demonstrate some of the skills needed to\nintegrate software from other languages into the Python Scientific\ncomputing ecosystem using subprocesses, ctypes, cython the Jupyter\nproject - and what do do when none of these approaches are the right.\n",
