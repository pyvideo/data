  "description": "You can now run Python 3.4 on microcontrollers that cost less than a cup\nof coffee (in a up-market Parisian restaurant :)\n\nMicroPython (http://www.micropython.org/) is a very active port of\nPython 3 to low-end microcontrollers with minimal RAM (eg. 192k RAM,\nyes: \"k\", as in kilobytes) but lots of useful I/O.\n\nLearn how to set up a very cheap microcontroller with wifi and a range\nof I/O and then program it with MicroPython.\n\nThe live demos are guaranteed to fail in spectacular ways as all live\ndemos do, but will hopefully show enough blinking lights to tempt you to\nleave your i7 hyperthreaded clusters and join the cute but very\npractical world of cheap, embedded Python.\n",
