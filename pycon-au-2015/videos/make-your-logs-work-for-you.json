  "description": "Any modern business generates a lot of logs - from customer transactions\nall the way to the technical logs of your servers. Many times these logs\nare thrown away or just sit uselessly somewhere on disk.\n\nI would like to show you how you can make sense of all that data, how to\ncollect and clean them, store them in a scalable fashion and, finally,\nexplore and search across various systems.\n\nOnce we have all the data in one place I will go over some examples of\nmore advanced analysis (beyond simple, though very useful, counting of\nthings) like finding patterns and trends in your data.\n\nWe will use Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana (aka the ELK stack) to\nachieve that. All tools presented are open source and examples will be\nusing real life use cases.\n",
