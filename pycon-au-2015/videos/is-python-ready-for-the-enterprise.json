  "description": "There seems to be an opinion among some developers that Python isn't\nsuitable for Enterprise. To put it another way, Python is great for\nsmall tasks where a scripting language works well, but not so suitable\nfor more complicated software stacks. This talk tries to address some of\nthese concerns. Specifically, we will look at:\n\n-  Python Typing System for large code bases.\n-  Is the GIL a problem?\n-  The speed of Python execution.\n-  The speed of Python development.\n-  A case study: Caterpillar.\n\n",
