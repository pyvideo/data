  "description": "The potential upside of microservices is significant and exciting. So\nmuch so that Yelp's Transaction Platform committed from the start to an\narchitecture of small, cooperative microservices. This talk explores the\ninevitable complications that arise in successful projects based on\nmicroservices as they grow larger and stretch both their own\narchitecture and the developers responsible for them. Come hear tales of\nterror (tight coupling! low test coverage!), stories which will warm\nyour heart (agility! strong interfaces!), and everything in between as\nwe follow the adventures of our plucky team.\n\nThe talk will be focused on the functional, cultural, and reliability\nchallenges which occur as a microservices-based project evolves and\nexpands over time. Particular attention will be paid to where these\ndiverge from the utopian way microservices are often described, and to\nthe practical approaches your project can take to mitigate issues and\navoid the traps inherent in scaling up this type of approach. My goal is\nto share with attendees some mistakes we've made, some successful\nmethods for growing gracefully, and above all with useful (and maybe\nunexpected!) lessons from the trenches they can apply to their own work.\n",
