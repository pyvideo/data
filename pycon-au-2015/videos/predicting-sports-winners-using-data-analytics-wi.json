  "description": "The pandas and scikit-learn packages combine together to produce a\npowerful toolkit for data analytics. In this talk, we will be using them\ntogether to analyse the outcome of NBA games, trying to predict the\nwinner of a match. There is plenty of data out there to allow us to\ncreate good predictions \u2013 the key is getting it in the right format and\nbuilding the right model.\n\nIn this talk we will go through importing data from the net, cleaning it\nup, creating new features, and building a predictive model. We then\nevaluate how well we did, using recent NBA data. The model we use will\nbe a decision tree ensemble called a random forest.\n",
