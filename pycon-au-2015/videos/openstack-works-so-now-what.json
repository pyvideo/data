  "description": "While we've made a great big hoopla over the last few years about\ndeploying OpenStack and what our development process is and other\nfascinating topics, it turns out that a cloud is not particularly\ninteresting in and of itself. A cloud is a thing that you use to, well,\nDO something.\n\nThe OpenStack Infra team DO something with OpenStack clouds every day.\nIt turns out it is related to both developing and deploying OpenStack,\nbut let's forget about that for now. What we really are is a giant\nmachine for manipulating OpenStacks, and we've gotten rather good at it.\nAs a result of that ... we've been good little hackers and have produced\na library, called shade, which is the embodiment of the knowledge we've\ngathered in trying to do useful things. shade is at the heart of our\nnodepool project, as well as the basis of the latest set of Ansible\nmodules for OpenStack.\n\nSo - Let's talk about shade. And let's talk about Ansible. And let's\ntalk about using clouds to actually perform work.\n",
