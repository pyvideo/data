  "description": "The ``cryptography`` library emerged in 2014 with the goal of becoming\nPython's \"cryptographic standard library\". It is designed to be easy to\nuse but flexible, exposing a *recipes* layer for common use cases, and a\n*hazmat* layer that provides crypto primitives but demands users know\nwhat they're doing in order to use them properly.\n\nThis talk will explain the motivations and goals of the ``cryptography``\nlibrary, take a tour of its features and discuss its implementation.\n``cryptography`` will be compared to some other popular and emerging\ncrypto libraries. Finally, we will examine some real-world use of the\nlibrary.\n\nAudience members should have a passing familiarity with cryptography\n(e.g. know the differences between hashing and encryption, or public key\nand private key crypto) to get the most out of this talk.\n",
