  "description": "Ponente: Juan Aragon\nTítulo: Demystifying stepping down. Reversing a career in Software\nAula: Teoría 7 (Sábado)\n---------------------------------------\nResumen:\nThe industry tends to present career progression in a very structured way. It seems that progress is to move up in the career ladder. Is there a way down too?\n\nThis is an inspirational talk about a career in Software. A journey that will show that a career in tech can be a dynamic and flexible path full of avenues to explore. I will talk about how I became an Engineering Manager and why I decided to step down to become an Individual Contributor.\n\nDuring this talk I will talk about how I became an Engineering Manager. What mistakes I made during my career and what I learned from them. I will talk about job satisfaction and what it means. Show what I have valued and why I took the decision to become an IC after 4 years as EM.\nI hope what I share will inspire people in different stages in their careers and show them that even when they think they are not advancing they are.",
