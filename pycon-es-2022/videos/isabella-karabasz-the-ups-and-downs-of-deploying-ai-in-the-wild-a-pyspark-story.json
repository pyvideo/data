A pyspark story\nAula: Teoría 7 (Sábado)\n----------------------------------\nResumen:\nHave you ever faced a professional challenge where you just didn’t know where to start?\u200b\n\nWhat happens to an AI model once it’s been trained and tested? In this talk, I’m going to share how I transformed into a data engineer for the duration of two weeks, while on the mission to deploy our python AI models in a Cloudera datalake using PySpark.\n\nIn this personal story of a real life challenge, I will discuss the AI solution that our team developed in python for the classification of bank transactions. We will explore the challenges faced during the deploy of the solution using pyspark and its integration in the client platform. Finally, we will take a look at what the future holds for our AI solution during the next steps of productionalization of this project.",
