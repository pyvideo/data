    "description": "Have you used Python's `match` statement? How do you decide when to use `match` instead of a typical `if`/`elif`/`else` statement? Although structural pattern matching functionality has been available in Python for years, many Python developers still aren't sure about the best way to employ `match` in their own programs.\r\n\r\nThis talk will explore effective patterns that work well with the new `match` statement, and common pitfalls to avoid. It will highlight when `if`/`elif`/`else` constructs are a better fit, and how to judge when it's time to consider moving from one style to another. The talk will also cover other approaches to matching patterns, including look-up tables for performance and unpacking for sequences.\r\n\r\nAfter attending this talk, you'll be able to confidently use the `match` statement to enhance your programs and discern when `match` will harm the readability of your code.",
