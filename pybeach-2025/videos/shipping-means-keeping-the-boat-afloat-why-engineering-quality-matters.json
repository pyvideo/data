    "description": "More software is being produced today than ever before. Good software developers want to maintain high standards for quality, but may find it challenging to do so in the face of day-to-day pressures, deadlines, and distractions. Non-developers may feel it's acceptable to stop short of full engineering practice. In this talk we'll explore what engineering rigor looks like and discuss ways to uphold standards, even in the face of resistance. Attendees should come away with an understanding that engineering quality is more than just an ideal worth striving for, but a pragmatic way to keep our users happy, and to stay productive without burning out.",
