    "description": "If your Python code works with file paths, you should be using `pathlib`. This standard library module may seem a bit cumbersome at first, but `pathlib`-using code is often more readable the alternative.\r\n\r\nPython's many path-oriented utilities used to expect a string representation for all file paths. That's not the case anymore. Now, every important path-consuming library will accept `pathlib.Path` objects.\r\n\r\nDuring this talk, we'll see why `pathlib.Path` objects make for more maintainable code. We'll visit a number of useful `pathlib` examples and recipes along the way.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this talk, you'll be tempted to convert all your path-handling code to use `pathlib`.",
