    "description": "Python's popularity comes from its vast ecosystem of open-source packages, especially for the development for AI modeling and support. However, many Python programmers struggle to share their scripts and packages with others due to a lack of understanding about Python packaging.\r\nJoin me on a journey to demystify modern Python packaging and learn the end-to-end mechanism of creating, publishing, and managing Python packages. Whether you are new to Python packaging or want to sharpen your skills around modern Python packaging techniques or are a curious Pythonista, I hope for everyone to learn something new here or just have fun with packaging!",
