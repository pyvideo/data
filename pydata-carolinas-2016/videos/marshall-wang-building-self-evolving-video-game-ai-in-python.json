  "description": "In this talk we will look at a few machine learning algorithms and\ntheir Python implementations to build AI's that can play LaserCat, a\nvideo game written with Pygame. We start with building an imitation AI\nthat can imitate a human player's decision-making. Then we build a\nself-evolving AI that can explore and learn on its own to eventually\nachieve super-human level.",
