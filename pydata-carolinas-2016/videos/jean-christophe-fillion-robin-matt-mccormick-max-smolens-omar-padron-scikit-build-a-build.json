  "description": "In this talk we present \"scikit-build\", an improved build system\ngenerator for CPython C extensions. It provides better support for\nadditional compilers, build systems, cross compilation, and locating\ndependencies and determining their build requirements. We also\ndescribe how Matplotlib and SymEngine are updated to make use of\n\"scikit-build\"\n\nAlthough the scientific packages NumPy, SciPy, SymEngine or Matplotlib\ncan be used from Python today, since they bundle C, C++ or Fortan\nextensions, successfully building the associated binary wheels is\ncomplex and prone to errors. This is a significant barrier to allow\nuse of these scientific packages on a broader set of platforms like\nmobile, Raspberry Pi or HPC.\n\nTo facilitate the build process, the scikit-build package is\nfundamentally just glue between the setuptools Python module and\nCMake. Currently, the package is available to perform builds in a\nsetup.py file. In the future, the project aims to be a build tool\noption in the currently developing pyproject.toml build system\nspecification.",
