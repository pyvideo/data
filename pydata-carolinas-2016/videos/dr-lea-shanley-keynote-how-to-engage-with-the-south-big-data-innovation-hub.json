To exploit the full potential of Big Data, the Big\nData Innovation Hubs endeavor to foster innovation through\ncollaboration, diversity, education, and workforce development.\n\nIn recognition of the substantial and growing impact of big data to\nthe U.S., across sectors, in 2012 the White House launched a multi-\nagency research initiative to foster and coordinate big data\ninnovation across the US. Under this initiative, the National\nFoundation launched four Big Data Regional Innovation Hubs, new\norganizations intended to develop the Big Data innovation ecosystem\nand facilitate thematic communities\u2019 use of data sciences for societal\nbenefit. Specifically, the Big Data Regional Innovation Hubs\naccelerate partnerships among people in business, academia, and\ngovernment who apply data science and analytics to help solve regional\nand national challenges. The Big Data Hubs cover all 50 states and\ncurrently include several hundred universities, corporations, federal\nagencies, and non-governmental organizations. Dr. Shanley will\nintroduce the Big Data Hubs and report on some of the significant\nactivities of the South Big Data Innovation Hub. Finally, she will\ndiscuss opportunities to engage with the Big Data Hubs and our growing\nnetworks of Public/Private partnerships. http://southbigdatahub.org",
