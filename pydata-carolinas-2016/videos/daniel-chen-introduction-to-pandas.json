  "description": "This tutorial aims to expose future data analysis with the Python\nPandas library. The tutorial is meant for absolute beginners to Pandas\nand Python as a programming language. We will begin with loading\ntabular data and various ways to calculate summary statistics and\nvisualize data. Next, we will learn various ways to join multiple\ndatasets, and how we can work with missing values etc.\n\nThe purpose of the tutorial is to expose users to Pandas for data\nanalysis and move users into a more reproducible analysis workflow\ncompared to spreadsheet programs. The tutorial will begin with loading\nin tabular data and various ways to view columns and rows of data. The\ninitial part of the tutorial will show users how to load in data and\nquickly create descriptive statistical plots. Next, we will cover more\nof pandas internal data structures. This will cover some fundamental\nknowledge about Python as a programming language, mainly object\nmethods. Finally, before showing users basic data cleaning examples,\nwe will cover data visualizations using matplotlib, seaborn, and\npandas itself.\n\nThe next section of the tutorial will show learners how to assemble\nand merge multiple datasets, and how to work with missing values.\nLastly, before we get to fitting models, I will go over how to recode\nvariables for analysis.\n\nThe main purpose is to show users how to use Pandas, and not how to\nfit machine learning models. However, I show a simple model at the end\nso users see how data cleaning and analysis all fit together in a\nworkflow.",
