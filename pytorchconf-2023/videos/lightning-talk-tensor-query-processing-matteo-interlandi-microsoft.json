  "description": "Lightning Talk: Tensor Query Processing - Matteo Interlandi, Microsoft\n\nThe huge demand for computation in artificial intelligence (AI) is driving unparalleled investments in new hardware and software systems for AI. This leads to an explosion in the number of specialized hardware devices, which are now part of the offerings of major cloud providers. Meanwhile, by hiding the low-level complexity through a tensor-based interface, machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch allow data scientists to efficiently exploit the exciting capabilities offered by the new hardware. In this talk, we will present how databases can ride the wave of innovation happening in the AI space thanks to Tensor Query Processor (TQP): a SQL query processor leveraging the tensor interface of PyTorch. TQP can efficiently run the full TPC-H benchmark by implementing novel algorithms for executing relational operators on the specialized tensor routines provided by PyTorch. Meanwhile, TQP can target various hardware while only requiring a fraction of the usual development effort.",
