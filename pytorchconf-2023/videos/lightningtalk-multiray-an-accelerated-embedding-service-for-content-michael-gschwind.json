  "description": "LightningTalk: MultiRay: An Accelerated Embedding Service for Content Understanding - Michael Gschwind, Meta\n\nWe present an overview of MultiRay, our high performance embedding service. The service provides a shared inference architecture that provides embeddings for content, and serves a small set of foundation models shared by all use cases. At present, we are serving 3 embedding services, for text understanding (TextRay), image understanding (ImageRay) and multi-modal whole-post understanding (text, image, etc) (PostRay). The system serves over over 800B requests daily, with up to 20M queries per second, serving over 125 different use cases.",
