  "description": "Lightning Talk: Streamlining Model Export with the New ONNX Exporter - Maanav Dalal & Aaron Bockover, Microsoft\n\nJoin us for a 10-minute talk on the new TorchDynamo-based ONNX exporter, redefining how we convert machine learning models to the ONNX format, with the power of PyTorch 2.0. The talk covers: Exporting with torch.onnx.dynamo_export, Inference with ONNXRuntime, and a variety of of State-of-the-Art models being converted easily. Learn about how ONNX enables more PyTorch models to be cross-platform, all the great benefits of ONNX standard, and all the other features we have baked into the new exporter, including: Symbolic model tracing: Export large models without computation cost involving original data/parameters, saving time and preventing OOM issues. ONNX Script: A new way to architect ONNX Models and the backbone of the Dynamo Exporter Preserving original modules structure as ONNX functions: allowing for a better resulting model that is layered. Better diagnostics: Clearly identify the root of your conversion issues faster!",
