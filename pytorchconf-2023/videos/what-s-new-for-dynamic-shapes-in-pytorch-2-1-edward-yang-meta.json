  "description": "What's New for Dynamic Shapes in PyTorch 2.1 - Edward Yang, Meta\n\nLast year, we announced dynamic shapes support in PT2. We have come a long way since that announcement, with a lot new features, case studies and debugging tools for using dynamic shapes. This talk will dive into all of the new developments for dynamic shapes in PT2, arguably one of the most new and unusual features of the PT2 compiler stack.",
