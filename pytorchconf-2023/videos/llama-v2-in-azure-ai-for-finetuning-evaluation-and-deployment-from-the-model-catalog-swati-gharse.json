  "description": "Llama V2 in Azure AI for Finetuning, Evaluation and Deployment from the Model Catalog - Swati Gharse, Microsoft\n\nLlama 2 is now available in the model catalog in Azure Machine Learning. The model catalog in AzureML is your hub for foundation models. Azure native support for Llama 2 in the model catalog enables you use these models, without having to manage any of the infrastructure or environment dependencies. It provides out-of-the-box support for model finetuning and evaluation, \u202fand includes options for optimizer libraries like DeepSpeed and ORT (ONNX RunTime), which speed up fine-tuning, and LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models), which greatly reduces memory and compute requirements for fine-tuning. Deployments of Llama 2 models in Azure have Azure AI Content Safety integrated by default, offering a built-in layered approach to safety, and following responsible AI best practices.",
