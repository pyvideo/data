  "description": "Lightning Talk: Enhancements Made to MPS Backend in PyTorch for Applications Running on Mac Platforms - Kulin Seth, Apple\n\nSince PyTorch 2.0, MPS backend has qualified for \u201cbeta\u201d stage which provides wider operator support (300+) and network coverage. We will provide details about new features introduced in MPS backend such as how to add custom operations to your network and profiling applications using MPSProfiler & Instruments. Finally we will provide some debugging tips and best practices on MPS device and conclude with performance results on popular benchmarks.",
