  "description": "PyTorch Korea User Group: The Beginning, Present, and Future - Junghwan Park, PyTorch Korea User Group\n\nAs a lead maintainer, I'd like to talk about the PyTorch community in Korea. Here\u2019re some agenda I'm currently thinking about: - How we got started (since 2018) - How we're growing (during Covid-19) - What we want to do in the future - A guide for people who want to start a local community I\u2019d like to talk about what inspired me to start the community, what I've learned along the way, and what other maintainers and I wish having done more of. I'll also include some tips and suggestions for those who want to start a local community like in Korea. With this talk, I hope to make more people aware of how the PyToch user community in Korea has been self-sustaining, and give them the courage to get involved.",
