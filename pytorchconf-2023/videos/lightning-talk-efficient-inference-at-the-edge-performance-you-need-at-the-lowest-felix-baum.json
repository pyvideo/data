  "description": "Lightning Talk: Efficient Inference at the Edge: Performance You Need at the Lowest Power You Deserve - Felix Baum, Qualcomm\n\nMost AI algorithms created for edge applications are initially developed on workstations. Developers then often struggle to get these workloads running on edge devices and achieve performance levels required for new and innovative use cases. This holds true for a wide range of applications, from IoT to automotive to XR to mobile to compute. In this session we would cover the results of the collaborative effort between PyTorch and Qualcomm teams to integrate the Qualcomm AI Stack into PyTorch 2.0 workflow and how we streamlined the path for developers from initial algorithm development to edge deployment. This would make it easy to re-target algorithms to edge hardware by supporting framework and data types that PyTorch developers are familiar with and we provide a set of tools that empower developers to extract the best performance and energy efficiency from their Android handsets to enable advanced use cases with premium features, performance boosts and power savings.",
