  "description": "Lightning Talk: PT2 Export - A Sound Full Graph Capture Mechanism for PyTorch - Avik Chaudhuri, Meta\n\nIn this session, we will introduce torch.export(), which is an Ahead-of-Time full graph capture mechanism with soundness guarantees. It is built on top of same foundational technology as torch.compile(). We recommend torch.export() for vendors integration and users who have requirements of running PyTorch program without Python.",
