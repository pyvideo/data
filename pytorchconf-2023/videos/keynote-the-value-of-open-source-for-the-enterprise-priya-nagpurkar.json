  "description": "Open-source communities accelerate innovation by empowering members to harness collective insights and build on a vast prior body of work. However, achieving a successful and responsible open-source community, and how enterprise companies should contribute to these communities, can be a delicate balance. Priya Nagpurkar, who leads the strategy for AI and cloud platforms at IBM Research, will discuss what IBM looks for in open-source collaborators, how PyTorch forwards IBM's strategic goals, and the role open-source technologies will play in generative AI’s future.",
