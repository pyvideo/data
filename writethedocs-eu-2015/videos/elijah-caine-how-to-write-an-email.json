Despite how we feel about it, we\nhave to deal with email almost every single day. Fortunately we can\nimprove email as a whole by learning how to write email that sucks just\na little bit less -- not that you write bad emails.. this talk is for\nyour... friend. Yeah, this talk is for your friends that really need to\nsetup up their email game.\n\nIn addition to email this talk will explore some fundamental\nmisunderstandings that people have with modes of online communication\nand how to correct these misunderstandings. Like how to craft a good\nTweet, Facebook Post, and Instant Messaging interaction.\n\nThis is not meant to be a tutorial but rather a conceptual guide for how\nto think about on-line communication and how to correct some common\nfaults we share as members of the on-line community. The Internet isn't\ngoing away anytime soon, and the amount we communicate over it is not\ngoing to diminish anytime soon either. This talk attempts to teach one\nhow to make digital communication as painless as possible.\n",
