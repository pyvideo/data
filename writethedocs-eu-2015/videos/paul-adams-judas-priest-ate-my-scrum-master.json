  "description": "Community Management in Free Software communities is still an emerging\nfield and has produced a spectrum of practitioners: from\nmaster-manipulators of social media, to those more focused on metrics\nand data as a means to driving process. Either way, the state of the art\nis still largely driven by the needs of technical contributors to\nprojects.\n\nGood documentation is a crucial component in a software product and yet\noften technical writers are overlooked as important stakeholders of the\nprocess. Within the community, there are undoubtedly common problems\nbetween engineers and technical writers. Software Engineering is full of\nlaws; can we show that these laws apply to technical writers as a means\nto help bridge the chasm between developers and technical writers??\n\nIn this talk Paul walks us through a selection of his favourite laws of\nsoftware engineering and explores how developers measure them and if\ntechnical writers must also obey them. Or not. And what that means for\nthe success of documentation in a Free Software project.\n",
