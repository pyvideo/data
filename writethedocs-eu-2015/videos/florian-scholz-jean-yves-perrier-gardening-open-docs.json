  "description": "With about 1000 different editors each month, the Mozilla Developer\nNetwork (MDN) documentation Web site for Open Web technologies is a\ntrafficked wiki with edits of all kind of quality: perfect text from\nseasoned professional writers to rough notes by teen-aged technology\nlearners.\n\nIn this talk, we are going to explore how to keep this doc garden clean,\nhow the diversity of editors influence its evolution, and how we find\nour way through treacherous jungles to well-maintained royal gardens.\n\nThis is about improving quality, working with diverse communities,\nfostering innovation, and carnivorous plants.\n",
