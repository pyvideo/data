  "abstract": "An everyday dilemma in technical communication: What do you call that\n\u201cthing\u201d? Whether you ask developers, marketing folks or users, you often\nget very different views.\n\nAlong with user interfaces, documentation helps all stakeholders align\ntheir mental model of a product. Terminology plays a key role, and a\ncontrolled vocabulary is an ace up the technical writer's sleeve.\n\nControlled vocabularies are basically lists of concepts and the\nrelationships between them. Beyond consistent naming, they are about\nstructuring, categorizing and retrieving content. For example, you can\nuse a vocabulary as a basis for documentation plans, tables of content,\na help site's navigation, search filters, or even to organize test\ncases.\n\nIn this talk, I will share ways to create and maintain various types of\nvocabularies, and explain what each type is useful for. You can start\nwith a flat list of terms and expand it into a glossary, a thesaurus, a\ntaxonomy, or even a full-fledge ontology.\n",
