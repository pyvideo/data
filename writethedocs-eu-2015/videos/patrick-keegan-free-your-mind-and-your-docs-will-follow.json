  "description": "As documentarians, we face plenty of hurdles to delivering what we are\nassigned (harried and inaccessible subject matter experts, barely\nfunctioning builds, sketchy doc infrastructure, etc.). But there are\nalso the obstacles that keep us from writing the docs we *want*, and\nthose are largely ingrained in our companies' processes and our own\nheads.\n\nWe pay lip service to \"the user\" but then subordinate that to concerns\nof structure, consistency, and stylistic conventions. The result is\noften docs that are internally consistent and satisfy the editorial,\ntranslation, and production teams for their economy and re-usability but\nare so dry and product-centered that they fail to connect with the most\nimportant audience - actual human beings.\n\nIn this presentation, I'll talk about ways to overcome burdensome\norganizational processes and our own timidity to create room for the\ninspiration and creativity needed to bring the docs' subject alive.\n",
