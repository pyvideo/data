  "abstract": "As a writer, it's been tough for me to admit that not everyone wants to\nread my carefully written documentation. While people will read, not\neveryone learns by reading the docs. Since my goal is to make sure my\ndocumentation can meet as many learning styles as possible, that has\nmeant spreading my documentarian wings and bridging out from only\nwriting the docs into recording them as well.\n\nPart of my documentation journey has been learning how to create\nscreencasts and I want to share that knowledge with everyone. From\npicking the right topics, to outlining, to writing a script (yes I\npromise, there is still writing involved), to how to record your audio\nand video, I'll cover it all. You don't need to be a professional voice\nactor or videographer to create a screencast, even a writer can create\nsomething wonderful.\n",
