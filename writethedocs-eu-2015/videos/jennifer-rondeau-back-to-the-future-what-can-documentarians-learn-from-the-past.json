  "description": "The world of software development rightly demands an emphasis on the new\nand the innovative -- on doing things differently from how they\u2019ve been\ndone. The assumption is that newer is (almost) always better. But if we\nlook only to the present and the future, we risk reinventing the wheel,\nfailing to understand that we are all built on tradition, failing to\nlearn everything that we could from the past.\n\nThis talk shows how documentarians can find inspiration in the past,\nbuild on it, and move forward. It tells some of these stories, and shows\nwhat they meant in historical context:\n\n-  The pre-history and dawn of software documentation -- how technical\n   writers were hired, how they worked, what they made, the challenges\n   they faced, and how their solutions continue to inform the work we do\n   today\n-  The much longer history of teaching engineers to write documentation\n-  Efforts to make technical writing into an independent profession\n",
