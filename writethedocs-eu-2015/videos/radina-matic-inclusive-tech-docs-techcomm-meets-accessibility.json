  "description": "Presenting a business case for quality documentation can sometimes be a\ndifficult enough task. Adding to that the accessibility requirements,\nand the whole idea may resemble a mission impossible. The fact that\nofficial standards (WCAG and WAI-ARIA) themselves seem to require user\nmanuals in order to be properly implemented, is not helping developers,\ntechnical communicators and content managers achieve the desired\nresults. This talk will present the main points and a selection of tools\nto get through the labyrinth of WCAG techniques and guidelines, and help\nyou make your techcomm project accessibility-ready. Welcome to A11y for\nTech Docs!\n",
