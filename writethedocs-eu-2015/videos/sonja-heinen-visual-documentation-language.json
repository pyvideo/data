  "description": "A picture says more than \u2026how many lines of code?\n\nFirstly this talk offers an introduction to a variety of established as\nwell as experimental visual documentation methods. Subsequently, it\nexplores the question whether or not these approaches can be applied to\nsoftware documentation in a reasonable way.\n\nIn this regard it takes a closer look at individual methods and\nestimates their corresponding affordances in terms of time, skill,\nresources and potential automatization.\n\nEventually, this talk presents an initial attempt to translate existing\ndocs into visual languages and discusses the according outcomes.\n\nPrimarily, the objective of reading and writing the docs serves the\npurpose to convey clear, unambiguous information, at the same time, the\nexperience should be as engaging and pleasant as possible. Building a\nVisual Documentation Language serves to reach this goal.\n",
