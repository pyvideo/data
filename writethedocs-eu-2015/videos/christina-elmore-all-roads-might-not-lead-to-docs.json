  "description": "Whilst not a part of the core documentation of projects, presentations\nand delivering them to the public are an essential part of spreading the\nword about what you do.\n\nThey need to be as equally consistent with your messaging and style\nguides, get to a key point effectively and also allow the presenter to\ninject some personality.\n\nThis is especially hard with technical projects where the 'story' is\neither hard to explain or can't just end up sounding like a sales pitch.\n\nIn this presentation I will explore and explain my experiences as an\nadvocate for several open source projects, audience reactions to those\npresentations and how I have iterated my presentations in sync with\nchanges to product and branding.\n",
