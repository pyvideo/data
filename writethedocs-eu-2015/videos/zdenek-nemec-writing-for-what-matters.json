  "description": "Most of the documentation we read today puts a lot of burden on us\nbefore we have the chance to get to the gist. Abstract and clear\nconcepts are replaced by concrete and comprehensive ones. The real\nvalues are hindered by opaque clouds of facts about tools of trade. As a\nresult, thinking and imagination are suppressed.\n\nBut what if we can write documentation that encourages thinking?\n\nLet's look together on what really matters when documenting computer\nsystems. We will discuss how a documentation and system design can walk\nhand in hand and to improve the communication between both humans and\nmachines.\n",
