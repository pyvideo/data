  "description": "Good documentation is important, but it should be your last resort. You\nneed to help users before they reach the docs - in the user interface\nitself.\n\nIn this talk, I'll discuss:\n\n-  strategies for writing microcopy when you\u2019re short on space\n-  what to explain in the UI, and what to save for the documentation\n-  how to pick the right style of embedded help\n-  what makes a great error message (and a terrible one)\n\n... with plenty of real-world examples of doing it right and wrong.\n",
