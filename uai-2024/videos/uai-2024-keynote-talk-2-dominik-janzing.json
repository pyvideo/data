  "description": "Dominik Janzing\nAmazon Research, Germany\n\nTitle:\nAll causal DAGs are wrong but some are useful\n\nAbstract:\nWhile the quote \u201call models are wrong but some are useful\u201d is widely known in statistics, discussions around causal DAGs and causal discovery seem to assume the existence of a \u201ctrue DAG\u201d. This assumption is problematic as it often results in causal graphs that are less useful. But first we should ask: useful for which purpose? I try to give an incomplete list of more than 5 different tasks for which causal DAGs may help. As not all of these tasks require ground truth from interventions (after all, interventions are often not only impossible, but even ill-defined), I propose that causal discovery should be benchmarked against them. This way, I hope that causal discovery research can gain new momentum after an honest assessment of the current state-of-the-art, using well-defined performance metrics on real data. Further, I hope that these tasks shed some light on the meaning of causality.\n\nSome related work:\n1) Faller, Vankadara, Mastakouri, Locatello, Janzing: Self-compatibility: Evaluating causal discovery without ground truth, AISTATS 2024\n2) Gresele, Von K\u00fcgelgen, K\u00fcbler, Kirschbaum, Sch\u00f6lkopf, Janzing: Causal inference thorugh the causal marginal problem.
