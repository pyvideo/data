  "description": "This talk focuses on the underrepresentation of women in AI and data science, where only 22% of AI professionals are women. We will explore how addressing the missing 78% is critical to creating inclusive, innovative solutions that benefit society as a whole. Attendees will learn about the current challenges women face, the importance of diverse perspectives in AI development, and actionable strategies for empowering women in the field through community engagement, mentorship, and data-driven policies.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other.
