Today, modern LLM-based voice bots can listen to users, talk back to them with a realistic voice, handle interruptions and improvise, while sticking to the goal they're given by their builders. And this is not only true for the latest, eye-watering expensive OpenAI's models! In this session we will learn how modern voice bots are made, which open source tools are available to build them, and we are going to see in practice how to build one. At the end of the session, the demo's full source code will be shared with the audience.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
