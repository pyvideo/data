Do you have a long list of different metrics that you have to keep track of that could potentially signal a problem? When evaluating user experiences, how can you quantify if it\u2019s a good experience or not? Additionally, how do you know if your good or bad experience is impacting other areas of the business?\n\nThese are common problems for product managers and the data scientists and analysts who support them. To solve them, I propose creating an aggregate metric that represents the effort or friction experienced by your users - a User Effort Index.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
