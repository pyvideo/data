In this session, we\u2019ll explore our hybrid approach, blending vector search with traditional keyword indexing to deliver high quality, accurate results. Discover how we harness a high-performance NoSQL database for efficient data management and fine-tune our results with a re-ranking algorithm for top-notch accuracy.\nWe\u2019ll dive into the hurdles we overcame, like ensuring data consistency in a NoSQL setup, balancing search precision and performance, and designing a scalable architecture. By the end, you\u2019ll understand how this Python-powered engine works, its real-world applications, and the innovative solutions that set it apart.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
