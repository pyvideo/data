We will write a simple Python application to collect various structured, semistructured data and unstructured data, We will process, enrich, augment and vectorize this data and insert it into a Vector Database to be used for semantic hybrid search and filtering. We will then build a Jupyter notebook to analyze, query and return this data.\n\nAlong the way we will learn the basics of Vector Databases and Milvus. While building it we will see the practical reasons we choose what indexes make sense, what to vectorize, how to query multiple vectors even when one is an image and one is text. We will see why we do filtering. We will then use our vector database of Air Quality readings to feed our LLM and get proper answers to Air Quality questions. I will show you how to all the steps to build a RAG application with Milvus, LangChain, Ollama, Python and Air Quality Reports. Finally after demos I will answer questions, provide the source code and additional resources including articles.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
