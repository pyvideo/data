CI is an essential part of ensuring quality, helping to highlight new issues before they might be merged into the main codebase. CI gives us confidence that the code changes being proposed don\u2019t break things, as least as far as our tests cover. That confidence comes at the cost of time and compute resources.\n\nThe RAPIDS team at NVIDIA manages its own operations and compute resources. Those resources are limited, of course, so we wait our turn and put the toys back when we\u2019re done.. It is essential to us that we are using our resources as efficiently as possible. This is the \u201cSpeed of Light\u201d principle at NVIDIA: how close are you to a theoretical optimal limit? For CI, this involves several factors: startup wait time, docker image setup time, cache utilization, build tool processes, and limiting unnecessary redoing builds and tests for things that haven\u2019t changed. The RAPIDS team set out to add telemetry to all of our builds, so that we can quantify where we are spending our time and compute resources, and ensure that we are spending them wisely. We\u2019ll demonstrate the telemetry tools that we\u2019re using, and show how you can add them to your build jobs.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
