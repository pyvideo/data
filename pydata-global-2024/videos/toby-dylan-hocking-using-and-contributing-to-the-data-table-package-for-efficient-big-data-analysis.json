First released to CRAN by Matt Dowle in 2006, it continues to grow in popularity, and now over 1500 other CRAN packages depend on data.table. This talk will start with data reading from CSV, discuss basic and advanced data manipulation topics, and finally will end with a discussion about how you can contribute to data.table.\n\nhttps://github.com/tdhock/2023-10-LatinR-data.table?tab=readme-ov-file#english\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
