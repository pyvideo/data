These deepfakes, made possible by advanced voice cloning tools like ElevenLabs and Respeecher, present risks in areas like misinformation, fraud, and privacy violations. The session will introduce deepfake audio, discuss current trends in voice cloning, and provide a hands-on tutorial for using these transformer-based models to identify synthetic voices by spotting subtle anomalies. Participants will learn how to set up these models, analyze deepfake audio datasets, and assess detection performance, bridging the gap between speech generation and detection technologies.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
