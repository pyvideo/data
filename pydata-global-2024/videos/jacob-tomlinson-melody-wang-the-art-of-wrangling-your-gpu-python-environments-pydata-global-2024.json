Understanding the intricate interactions between hardware, drivers, CUDA, C++ dependencies, and Python libraries can be far more complex.\n\nIn this talk we will dig into how these different layers interact and how you can address some of the common pitfalls that folks run into when configuring GPU Python environments. We will also introduce a new tool, RAPIDS Doctor, that aims to take the challenge out of ensuring your software environments are in good shape. RAPIDS Doctor checks and diagnoses environmental health issues straight from the command line, ensuring that your setup is fully functional and optimized for performance.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
