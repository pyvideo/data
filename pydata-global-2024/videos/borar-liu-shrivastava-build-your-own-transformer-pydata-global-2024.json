The answer lies in transformer, a powerful neural network architecture. In this workshop, we'll dive deep into the inner workings of transformers, with specific focus on self-attention mechanism. We will guide you through the process of building one from scratch. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced practitioner, this workshop is designed to cater to all levels of expertise.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
