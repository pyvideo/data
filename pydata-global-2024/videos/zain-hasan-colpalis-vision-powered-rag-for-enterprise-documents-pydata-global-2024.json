  "description": "Traditional document processing for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) often involves cumbersome, error-prone extraction pipelines, hampering AI's ability to retrieve high-quality information from complex formats like PDFs and PowerPoint decks. ColPali disrupts this process by embedding entire pages—text, visuals, and layout—into rich, multi-vector representations using Vision Language Models (VLMs). This talk explores how ColPali, paired with multimodal models like the Llama 3.2 Vision series, enables RAG systems to “see” and reason over documents, dramatically improving retrieval performance. Attendees will learn to implement ColPali for enhanced, scalable, and robust enterprise knowledge retrieval.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
