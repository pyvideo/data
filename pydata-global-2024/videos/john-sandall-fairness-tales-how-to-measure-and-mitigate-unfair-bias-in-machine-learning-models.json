We\u2019ll explore fairness metrics like statistical parity, counterfactual fairness, and equalized odds, and demonstrate how tools such as Fairlearn, Aequitas, and IBM Fairness 360 can be used to monitor and improve model fairness. Through hands-on exercises, participants will walk away with the skills to evaluate and de-bias models in high-risk areas like recruitment.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
