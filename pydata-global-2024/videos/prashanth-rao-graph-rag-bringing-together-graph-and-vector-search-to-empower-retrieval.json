  "description": "This talk will go over an application scenario that brings together the benefits of vector search with graph traversal. Knowledge graphs (or more generally, graphs), have long been used to model structured data that capture the connection between entities in the real world. Recently, there has been a lot of interest in the topic of Graph RAG, which aims to use graphs as part of the retrieval process in RAG, to enhance the outcomes. The talk will cover a practical example to showcase how Python developers can leverage the PyData ecosystem alongside two open source, embedded databases: Kùzu for the graph component, and LanceDB for the vector component of the retrieval.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
