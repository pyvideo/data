We'll focus on implementing five core elements: a feature store, model registry, orchestrator, inference engine, and basic monitoring system. The session emphasizes practical, hands-on coding using Test-Driven Development (TDD), Domain Driven Design, and hexagonal architecture principles providing attendees with a functional foundation for a robust ML infrastructure.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
