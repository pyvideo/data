To deliver reports to health authorities, clinical trial statisticians need to create several scripts to produce deliverables such as output datasets, tables, figures, and listings. Statisticians must also handle specific execution orders to respect dependencies between the generated datasets.\n\nOur project leverages Python programming to automatically generate orchestration workflows from clinical trial project metadata using the Snakemake framework. Snakemake supports the execution of multiple jobs using Docker containers, facilitating multilingual orchestration. This enables our users to run end-to-end (E2E) data engineering workflows using their preferred programming languages, primarily SAS and R. Moreover, Snakemake allows parallel runs for efficient workflow management.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
