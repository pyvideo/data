  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nBeneath the buzz of AI breakthroughs, a quiet revolution is unfolding in the world of forecasting: foundational time series models. These models promise to change the game for operational forecasting, but don\u2019t expect magic. You won\u2019t suddenly become a stock market oracle just by throwing data at them.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll peel back the layers of these new time series models, starting with how they work and how they evolved from transformers. We\u2019ll tackle the big problems of limited data and overhyped algorithms, and explore the real-world challenges that make or break forecasts (hint: human input matters).\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
