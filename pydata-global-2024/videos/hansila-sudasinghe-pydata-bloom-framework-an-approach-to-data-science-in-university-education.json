Data Science is nowadays a trending topic in any area like social science, finance, natural science and so many others. Therefore, every student in the university education is keen to learn data science using computer languages rather than using SPSS or other traditional data analysis tools especially related to research. So, this aims to develop a new curriculum for any student studying from any discipline in higher education to learn data science using trending techniques and tools. Python is the core programming language here because it is very widely used and related to data science field. Plus, it has many advantages like easy to learn and use, platform independence used, large and active community support. Utilizing Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy as the guiding framework has developed a new curriculum for four-year degree programs to succeed in data driven world considering multidisciplinary approach. In this curriculum, students can start from Python basic programming concepts to progress to advanced analyzing techniques using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn, and platforms such as Anaconda and Google Colab and finally build own projects in that students related discipline. Ultimately this curriculum will leverage success in Data-centric society in domain specific applications.\n\nKeywords: Bloom\u2019s, curriculum, multidisciplinary, python, science, taxonomy\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
