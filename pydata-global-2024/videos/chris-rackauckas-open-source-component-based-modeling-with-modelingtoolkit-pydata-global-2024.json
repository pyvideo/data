For example, Bob can build a model of an engine, and Alice can build a model of a drive shaft, and you can then connect the two models and have a model of a car. These kinds of tools are used all throughout industrial modeling and simulation in order to allow for \"separation of concerns\", allowing experts to engineer their domain and compose the final digital twins with reusable scientific modules. But what about open source? In this talk we will introduce ModelingToolkit, an open source component-based modeling framework that allows for composing pre-built models and scales to large high-fidelity digital twins.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
