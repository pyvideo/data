Using real-world business scenarios, I will demonstrate how to move beyond correlation-based predictions to more actionable decisions using PyMC\u2019s causal inference tools. Attendees will learn how to make forecasts for natural business conditions, simulate the effects of strategic changes (like increased advertising spend), and evaluate the causal impact of past price promotion with retrodictive causal inference.\n\nTarget audience: Data scientists, machine learning engineers, and business analysts looking to improve their decision-making using causal inference.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
