  "description": "To apply or not to apply, that is the question.\n\nCausal reasoning elevates predictive outcomes by shifting from “what happened” to “what would happen if”. Yet, implementing causality can be challenging or even infeasible in some contexts. This talk explores how the very act of assessing its applicability can add value to your projects. Through a gentle introduction to causal inference tools and practical use cases, you will learn how to bring greater scientific rigour to real-world problems.\n\nTarget audience: Practicing and aspiring data scientists, machine learning engineers, and analysts looking to improve their decision-making with causal inference.\n\nNo prior knowledge is assumed.\n\nFor the seasoned practitioners I hope to shine light on aspects that may not have been considered. 💡\n\nCan't make the talk?
