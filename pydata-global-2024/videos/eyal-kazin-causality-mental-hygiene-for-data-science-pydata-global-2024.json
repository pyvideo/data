Yet, implementing causality can be challenging or even infeasible in some contexts. This talk explores how the very act of assessing its applicability can add value to your projects. Through a gentle introduction to causal inference tools and practical use cases, you will learn how to bring greater scientific rigour to real-world problems.\n\nTarget audience: Practicing and aspiring data scientists, machine learning engineers, and analysts looking to improve their decision-making with causal inference.\n\nNo prior knowledge is assumed.\n\nFor the seasoned practitioners I hope to shine light on aspects that may not have been considered. \ud83d\udca1\n\nCan't make the talk?

PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
