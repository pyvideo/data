But it is pressing.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll talk about a realtime anomaly detection pipeline on time series data and discuss the nitty-gritties of the algorithm knobs that help us build an unbiased and reliable system, which includes 1) using NeuralProphet, an open source framework, to forecast for time series data and 2) using robust techniques to detect true anomalies using forecasting errors.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
