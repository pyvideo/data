Participants will learn to manage multimodal data (text, images, video) using Pixeltable's declarative interface. We'll cover data versioning, indexing, and orchestration through computed columns and iterators. Attendees will gain practical experience with Pixeltable's integration capabilities and custom UDFs.\n\nRequirements: Python knowledge, basic ML concepts. Materials will be available via a GitHub repository and Google Colab notebooks.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
