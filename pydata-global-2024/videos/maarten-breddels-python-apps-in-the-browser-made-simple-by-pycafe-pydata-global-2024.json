With PyCafe, you can offer users live, interactive examples of your libraries or have them submit reproducible examples when reporting issues.\nBuilt on top of Pyodide, PyCafe runs countless web frameworks (e.g. streamlit, dash, panel, gradio) directly in the browser. By making apps easy to create, share, and edit, PyCafe opens up new workflows, including possibilities we may not have even imagined yet.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
