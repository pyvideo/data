Relational data management systems provide transactional (\u201cACID\u201d) guarantees that can be immensely useful for data analysis. DuckDB provides all-or-nothing semantics for changes to datasets and is robust against failures of any kind. In this talk, we will illustrate the usefulness DuckDB\u2019s transactional facilities to bring sanity to changes to data analysis workflows in Python.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
