This shift is not just a trend; it\u2019s a response to the ever-increasing demand for precision and effectiveness in reaching potential customers in a crowded digital marketplace.\n\nAt the forefront of this evolution is our innovative automated system designed to identify high-intent users through sophisticated batch processing of their website behaviour. By harnessing the power of machine learning, we create a dynamic layer that curates smarter audiences those that closely resemble our most valuable converted customers. This enables us to execute precise retargeting campaigns that not only drive meaningful engagement but also optimize marketing budgets, resulting in enhanced audience selection and significantly higher conversion rates.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
