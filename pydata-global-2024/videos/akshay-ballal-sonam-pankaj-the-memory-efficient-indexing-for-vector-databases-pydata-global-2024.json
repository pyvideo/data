  "description": "Vector databases are everywhere, powering LLMs. But indexing embeddings, especially multivector embeddings like ColPali and Colbert, at a bulk is memory intensive. Vector streaming solves this problem by parallelizing the tasks of parsing, chunking, and embedding generation and indexing it continuously chunk by chunk instead of bulk. This not only increase the speed but also makes the whole task more optimized and memory efficient.\n\nThe library gives many vector database supports, like Pinecone, Weavaite, and Elastic.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
