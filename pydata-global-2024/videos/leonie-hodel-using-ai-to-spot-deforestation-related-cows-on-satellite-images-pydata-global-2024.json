We present a cutting-edge approach to monitoring illegal ranching, a primary driver of deforestation, using very high-resolution satellite imagery and deep learning. We'll dive into the unique challenges of detecting cattle from space \u2013 from congested scenes with small, clustered targets to diverse and cluttered backgrounds \u2013 and how we overcame them with a two-step neural network approach. By combining classification and density estimation techniques, our model efficiently identifies potential cattle locations and estimates herd sizes across varied landscapes. Discover how this interdisciplinary project, developed in collaboration with Brazilian prosecutors, leverages data science to drive real-world impact in environmental conservation and sustainable land management. Join us to explore the intersection of computer vision, geospatial analysis, and environmental advocacy, and learn how AI can be a powerful tool in the fight against deforestation in the Amazon and beyond.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
