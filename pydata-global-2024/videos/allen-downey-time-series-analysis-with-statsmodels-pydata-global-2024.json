This tutorial covers tools in the StatsModels library including seasonal decomposition and ARIMA. We'll develop the ARIMA model bottom-up, implementing it one piece at a time, and then using StatsModels. As examples, we'll look at weather data and electricity generation from renewable sources in the United States since 2004 -- but the methods we'll cover apply to many kinds of real-world time series data.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
