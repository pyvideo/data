  "description": "Join us for an exciting keynote from Peter Wang\n\nIn this talk, Peter walks through some of the most interesting learnings from the last few years of AI, as well as lessons learned over the last decade of Python's adoption for data science, in an effort to answer the question, \"What is the role of the open data science movement in the era of AI?\"\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
