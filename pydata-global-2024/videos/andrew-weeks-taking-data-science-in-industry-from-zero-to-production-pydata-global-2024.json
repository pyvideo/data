And Data Science has a particularly high failure rate, with a lot of ideas not getting beyond the prototype stage.\n\nBut there are real reasons for this: there is intrinsic and unknown complexity in data, and there are often big challenges knowing if we have actually solved the problem -- the answer is so rarely \"yes\" or \"no\".\n\nIn this talk I'll cover some key learnings from a decade working on DS problems at early- and later-stage startups, building products to improve product market fit.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
