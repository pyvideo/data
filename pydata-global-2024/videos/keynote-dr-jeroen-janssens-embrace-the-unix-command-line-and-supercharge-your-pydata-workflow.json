This talk will demonstrate how embracing the command line and leveraging its many tools can significantly enhance your productivity, streamline data workflows, and complement your Python skills.\n\nJeroen Janssens, PhD, is a polyglot data science consultant and certified instructor. His expertise lies in visualizing data, implementing machine learning models, and building solutions using Python, R, JavaScript, and Bash. Jeroen is passionate about open source and sharing knowledge. He is the author of Data Science at the Command Line (O\u2019Reilly, 2021) and is currently writing Python Polars: The Definitive Guide (O\u2019Reilly, 2025). Every now and then he blogs at https://jeroenjanssens.com.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
