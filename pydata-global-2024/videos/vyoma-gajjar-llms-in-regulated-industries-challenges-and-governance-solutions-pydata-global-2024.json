These industries face unique challenges, including data privacy, compliance with strict regulations, and minimizing the risks of biased or untrustworthy outputs.\n\nThis session will explore the complexities of using LLMs in regulated industries and present a governance framework to address these challenges. We'll cover practical solutions for deploying LLMs while adhering to industry-specific regulations, ensuring transparency, reducing bias, and maintaining data privacy. Attendees will learn how to implement governance best practices at various stages of the LLM lifecycle\u2014from model training and validation to deployment and ongoing monitoring.\n\nDrawing on real-world examples and lessons learned, this talk will equip data scientists, machine learning engineers, and AI leaders with actionable strategies for navigating regulatory compliance and minimizing risks, while still harnessing the full potential of LLMs to drive innovation.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
