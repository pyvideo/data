We'll begin by exploring a practical PyTorch workflow, then delve into integrating popular experiment tracking tools like MLFlow and Weights & Biases. You'll learn to log custom metrics, artifacts, and interactive visualizations, enhancing your model development process. Finally, we'll tackle hyperparameter optimization using Optuna's Bayesian search, all while maintaining meticulous experiment tracking for easy comparison and reproducibility.\n\nBy the end of the session, you'll have constructed a robust, modular pipeline for managing experiments and optimizing model performance. Whether you're new to PyTorch or an experienced data scientist looking to improve your workflow, this hands-on tutorial offers immediately applicable insights and techniques to enhance your deep learning projects across diverse domains.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
