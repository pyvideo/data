  "description": "Shiny for Python is an efficient and reactive application framework that will be able to grow with your application needs. As your shiny application grows, you may find yourself needing more custom behaviors and potentially reusing and sharing your custom behaviors with others. \nYou may also find your existing applications to be overly complex and had to see the overall structure of the application. Here are some tips on writing better Shiny Applications and leveling up your code.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
