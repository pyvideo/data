  "description": "To identify a production-ready, open-source OCR model capable of handling sensitive, non-English content with highly technical language, we evaluated the performance of available open-source OCR models in terms of accuracy, memory efficiency, and processing speed. This presentation will share our findings and key insights gained from this research\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
