  "description": "What if designing data workflows felt like snapping together LEGO blocks? In this talk, we’ll explore how open-source tools enable flexible, modular PyData workflows. We’ll discuss why open source is essential for avoiding vendor lock-in and how to integrate libraries and frameworks within the Python ecosystem, alongside tools like GitHub Actions. Plus, I’ll introduce DataJourney, an open-source toolkit I developed that makes designing workflows as fun and creative as building with LEGO.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
