The 10th carefully studies the floor in silence.\n\nThis talk is for engineers, developers or applied researchers who may or may not know of evaluation tools and metrics, but either way benefit from an overview of different risks in applications using LLMs for text generation, Open Source libraries they can use to mitigate these risks, and examples of how to use them.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
