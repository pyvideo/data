Participants learned about the inner workings of Python class creation, attribute lookup, and the impact of decorators and meta-classes on this process. The speakers dived into topics such as normal and special methods, descriptors, method resolution order, and the relationship between instances, classes, and metaclasses. They explained the role of metaclasses in giving classes special methods, intercepting class creation, preparing the class namespace, and detailed the methods `__call__`, `__new__`, and `__init__`. While emphasizing that creating a metaclass is rarely necessary, the speakers provided insights into `__init_subclass__`, class decorators, and capturing descriptor names and ordering. The session concluded with examples and a Q&A session, leaving attendees with a deeper understanding of metaprogramming in Python.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
