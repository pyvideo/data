He discusses the fusion of machine learning models with modern databases, unlocking unique capabilities for users. The talk outlines the transition from traditional model-building workflows to utilizing current databases for enhanced machine learning outcomes.\n\nAs the volume of data surged over the years, databases became the natural storage choice. Typically, data would be retrieved from databases, transformed into features, and used for model training. In some instances, these features would be stored in feature stores within databases for future use. Real-time model inference was enabled through services or API endpoints for delivering results to end-users.\n\nTo cater to evolving needs, modern databases now integrate features that facilitate machine learning model development. Gregor details the diverse offerings such as supporting common models like linear regression, image classification, and text processing. Moreover, these databases streamline model deployment by eliminating the need for external services for inference. Instead, they offer native interfaces like SQL queries for seamless inferencing.\n\nA notable example shared by Gregor illustrates the creation of a custom model in Python and its integration within Couchbase database. This integration simplifies the inference process by seamlessly incorporating the model into database queries. The talk underscores the profound impact of modern databases in advancing machine learning capabilities.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
