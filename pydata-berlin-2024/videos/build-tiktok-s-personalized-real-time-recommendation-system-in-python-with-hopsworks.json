The talk highlights the success of TikTok's Monolith recommendations engine, equated to \"digital crack\" by Andrej Karpathy, former head of AI at Tesla. The session focuses on constructing the core elements of TikTok Monolith, comprising a stream processing feature pipeline, a two-tower embedding model for tailored queries based on user history, and a user interface in Python using Streamlit. The real-time machine learning system comprises three Python programs: the feature pipeline, training pipeline, and online inference pipeline, all supported by Hopsworks platform's ML infrastructure, encompassing a feature store, vector database, model serving, and model registry. Attendees get hands-on experience developing these components and witnessing the system in action through a simple user interface.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
