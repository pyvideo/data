  "description": "\ud83d\udd0a Recorded at PyCon DE & PyData Berlin 2024, 22.04.2024\nhttps://2024.pycon.de/program/BFF9VA/\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Watch as privacy activist and data scientist Katharine Jarmul reveals the hidden truth about deep learning models memorizing training data and explores the legal risks and privacy implications associated with it.\n\nSpeakers:\nKatharine Jarmul\n\nDescription:\nKatharine Jarmul, a Principal Data Scientist at Thoughtworks, delivered a talk shedding light on the likelihood of deep learning models memorizing training data. She emphasized that even large models like language and multi-modal models are not immune to this phenomenon. Jarmul discussed the active research on deep learning memorization and its implications, highlighting scenarios where memorization could be beneficial and the associated legal and privacy risks. The talk covered various aspects including the mathematical rationale behind model memorization, successful attacks on deep learning models to extract memorized data, and the social and legal consequences of using such data. Jarmul also explored potential solutions like differential privacy, federated models, and distillation techniques to mitigate the risks posed by model memorization. Ultimately, the talk aimed to raise awareness about the issues surrounding model memorization and advocate for thoughtful consideration of privacy and security within data science workflows.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
