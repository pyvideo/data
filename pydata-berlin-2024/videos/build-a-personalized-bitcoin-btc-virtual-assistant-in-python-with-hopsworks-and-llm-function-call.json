The talk addresses the human desire for effortless wealth through cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, despite their unpredictability. The virtual assistant aims to assist in analyzing transaction history, predicting future BTC prices, and evaluating the future value of holdings. Powered by LLMs and utilizing Function Calling, this assistant recognizes user intent from conversation history. The ML system, following the FTI pipeline architecture, will be constructed in Python on the Hopsworks platform, offering essential ML infrastructure like a feature store and model serving.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
