David introduces Polylith, a Python-specific tool based on the Polylith Architecture originating from the Clojure community. Polylith promotes the use of small building blocks akin to LEGO bricks, facilitating code sharing and reuse within monorepos. By leveraging Polylith's developer-friendly tooling, developers can make design decisions seamlessly while building their projects. David's presentation offers insights into how Polylith can enhance the Python development process, making it more efficient and enjoyable.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
