  "description": "\ud83d\udd0a Recorded at PyCon DE & PyData Berlin 2024, 22.04.2024\nhttps://2024.pycon.de/program/WPKRCT/\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Watch Pavithra Eswaramoorthy and Philip Meier guide you through creating a cutting-edge AI Document Inquiry Chat system using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and large language models, transforming the way we interact with documents.\n\nSpeakers:\nPavithra Eswaramoorthy, Philip Meier\n\nDescription:\nPavithra Eswaramoorthy, a Developer Advocate at Quansight, and Philip Meier, a Senior Software Engineer at the same company, presented a tutorial on leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques in creating AI document inquiry chat systems. RAG enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing relevant external information, significantly improving accuracy. The tutorial featured hands-on sessions utilizing the Ragna project, designed for this purpose, to build personal chat apps answering questions about selected documents.\n\nThe session highlighted the transformative potential of natural language questions in making organizational knowledge accessible. It emphasized the limitations of directly using powerful LLMs like GPT4 for document inquiry, making RAG crucial for enhancing their capabilities. Participants learned to utilize RAG to develop chat systems using various commercial and local LLMs, optimizing performance through experiments with context windows and more.\n\nThe tutorial included an introduction to RAG's interaction with LLMs and Ragna, creating basic chat functions using popular LLMs, optimizing chat performance, running local LLMs on GPUs, and exploring REST APIs for building web apps. By the end, attendees gained a practical understanding of RAG components and open-source tools to develop their document inquiry applications using beginner-friendly Python libraries.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
