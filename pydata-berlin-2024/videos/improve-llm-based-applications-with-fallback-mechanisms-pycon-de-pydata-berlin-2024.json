Despite the advancements brought by the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach in addressing LLM challenges, issues like out-of-domain queries persist. Bilge emphasizes the importance of fallback mechanisms, like web searches and alternative data sources, in ensuring smooth system operation. The session explores various fallback techniques and practical implementations using Haystack, empowering developers to build robust LLM systems for diverse scenarios autonomously. Attendees will grasp how to select suitable fallback methods, enabling the development of reliable LLM applications effectively.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
