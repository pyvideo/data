The speakers, who are active contributors and maintainers in the Apache Arrow project, will shed light on the significance and utility of the Arrow format for efficient in-memory columnar data representation.\n\nThe tutorial aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the Arrow columnar format, including its different types and buffer layouts, providing participants with interactive demonstrations using the pyarrow and nanoarrow libraries. The talk emphasizes Apache Arrow as a multi-language toolbox for accelerated data interchange and in-memory processing, illustrating the format's role in enabling efficient analytic operations on modern hardware such as CPUs and GPUs.\n\nAttendees will have the opportunity to explore the physical memory layout and various data types associated with the Arrow columnar format. The talk will feature practical code examples using pyarrow and nanoarrow libraries, allowing participants to create and inspect Arrow data effectively. Furthermore, the discussion will highlight the broader applicability of the columnar format, as it underpins multiple libraries like pandas, polars, datafusion, duckdb, cudf, influxdb, among others.\n\nBy delving into the nuances of the Arrow columnar format and providing hands-on demonstrations with pyarrow and nanoarrow, the speakers will equip participants\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
