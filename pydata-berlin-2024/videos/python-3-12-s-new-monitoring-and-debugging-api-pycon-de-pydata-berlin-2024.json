The new low-impact monitoring API, introduced through PEP669, enables the development of faster debuggers than ever before. Historically lacking a robust monitoring and profiling API, Python previously relied on the sys.settrace API, which was inefficient and lacked configurability. The new monitoring API, launched in October 2023, provides a well-designed, fine-tuned alternative that significantly improves commonly used operations. During the talk, attendees gained insights into the API's key features and design decisions, learning how to leverage it to create efficient tools such as simple debuggers. Johannes Bechberger's expertise in JVM development and his proficiency in Python, cultivated over nearly a decade, made him a compelling speaker on this advanced technological subject.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
