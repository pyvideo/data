The current scikit-learn website uses an \"exact\" search engine that lacks the ability to handle spelling mistakes and natural language queries. To overcome these limitations, Guillaume and his team experimented with large language models (LLMs) and opted for a RAG system due to resource constraints.\n\nThe talk detailed the RAG pipeline stages, including documentation scraping strategies based on numpydoc and sphinx-gallery for lexical and semantic searches. Comparisons were made between the RAG approach and an LLM-only system, highlighting the contextual advantages of the former. The experimental code is available on GitHub for further exploration.\n\nChallenges and benefits of integrating the RAG system into open-source projects, such as hosting and cost considerations, were discussed. Guillaume emphasized the importance of open-source software stack and open-weight models in developing the RAG system for scikit-learn documentation queries.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
