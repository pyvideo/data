In the era of industry 4.0, the vast amount of sensor data poses challenges for manual monitoring. The tool conducts unsupervised anomaly detection on unlabelled data and presents potential anomalies to domain experts through a web app. Expert feedback generates a partially labelled dataset, enabling the refinement of anomaly detection algorithms. The framework, utilizing open source tools and cloud deployment, aims to enhance the accuracy of anomaly detection in time series data.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation. The PyCon DE & PyData Berlin 2024 conference, hosted in partnership with the local Berlin PyData chapter, provided an exceptional experience, fostering deeper connections within the Python community while showcasing advancements in AI and data science. Attendees enjoyed a diverse and engaging program, solidifying the event as a highlight for Python and AI enthusiasts nationwide.\n\nFollow us:\n   \u2022  LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/28908640/\n   \u2022  X: https://www.x.com/pyconde\n   \u2022  X: https://www.x.com/pydataberlin\n\nLinks:\n   \u2022 Conference website: http://pycon.de\n   \u2022 Related sessions: http://2024.pycon.de/program/categories/general-industry-academia-use-cases\n\nThe conference is organized by\n   \u2022 Python Softwareverband e.V.: http://pysv.org\n   \u2022 NumFOCUS Inc.: http://numfocus.org\n   \u2022 Pioneers Hub gemeinn\u00fctzige GmbH: http://pioneershub.org\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this session, please like, comment, and subscribe to our channel for more insightful talks and discussions.\nShare this video with your network to spread the knowledge!\n\nHashtags:\n#Python #PyConDE #PyData #OpenSource #AI #DataScience #MachineLearning #SoftwareDevelopment #LLMs #Community\n\nAcknowledgements:\nSpecial thanks to all the volunteers and sponsors who made this event possible.\n\nAbout:\nPython Softwareverband e.V.:\nPySV is a non-profit that promotes the use and development of Python in Germany through events, education, and advocacy, fostering an open Python community.\n\nNumFOCUS Inc.\nsupports open-source scientific computing by providing financial and logistical support to key projects like NumPy and Jupyter, promoting sustainable development and collaboration.\n\nPioneers Hub gemeinn\u00fctzige GmbH:\nis a non-profit fostering innovation in AI and tech by connecting experts and promoting knowledge exchange through events and collaborative initiatives.\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
