With a background in Mathematics and expertise in pandas and Polars, Marco will cover basic built-in time series operations and demonstrate how to extend Polars using numba, numpy, and scipy for more complex tasks like non-linear interpolation. Attendees will also learn how to implement advanced, custom time series operations as Polars plugins, such as business day arithmetic. The talk will assume basic Python and data knowledge but no prior experience with Polars. By the end of the session, participants will be equipped to tackle any time series analysis task using Polars effectively.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
