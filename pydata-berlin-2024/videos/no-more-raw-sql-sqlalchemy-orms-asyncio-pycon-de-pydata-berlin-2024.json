Participants will learn how to use SQLAlchemy's Object Relational Mapper (ORM) system and asyncio extension to interact with databases asynchronously. The interactive tutorial will cover topics such as setting up SQLAlchemy, utilizing ORMs, improving performance with relationship-loading techniques, and using SQLAlchemy's asyncio extension. The workshop will provide hands-on experience through GitHub Codespaces, enabling participants to work on a repository with all necessary modules and a Dockerized PostgreSQL database. Python developers of all levels who work with databases and want to enhance their database interaction using SQLAlchemy are encouraged to attend. Basic knowledge of databases and SQL is recommended, while prior experience with SQLAlchemy or ORMs is not required. By the end of the workshop, participants will have a strong grasp of using SQLAlchemy for database operations, building ORM classes, optimizing querying performance, and leveraging asyncio for asynchronous database interactions.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
