He discussed the challenges hindering the utilization of RL in real-world settings, pointing out the lack of mature software frameworks tailored to facilitate its implementation. Panchenko introduced the open-source library Tianshou, designed to streamline RL application development for both researchers and engineers. This library offers high-level interfaces for seamless integration of RL algorithms in industrial scenarios, while also providing lower-level APIs to cater to the specific needs of researchers.\n\nPanchenko highlighted the disparity between the vast potential of RL in various decision-making processes and its limited current applications across industries. He noted that crucial advancements in RL research often fail to be incorporated into existing frameworks, and successful industry applications of RL are seldom shared in open-source platforms. The complexity of RL, compared to supervised learning, was identified as a significant barrier to its widespread adoption in software development.\n\nDrawing parallels to the evolution of PyTorch and Keras in deep learning, Panchenko expressed optimism about the future of RL software, envisioning a landscape that would simplify the implementation of RL tasks for both researchers and machine learning engineers. He emphasized the efforts of the appliedAI Institute for Europe and Tianshou developers in enhancing the library to democratize RL applications and expedite reliable research in the field.\n\nPanchenko underscored the significance of Tianshou's high-level interfaces for effortless integration of RL\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
