  "description": "\ud83d\udd0a Recorded at PyCon DE & PyData Berlin 2024, 24.04.2024\nhttps://2024.pycon.de/program/TCSERC/\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Watch as Jannis L\u00fcbbe discusses how to enhance your balcony power plant with Python, covering the basics of plug-in solar systems, energy consumption, and optimizing power output for sustainability.\n\nSpeakers:\nJannis L\u00fcbbe\n\nDescription:\nJannis L\u00fcbbe, Sensor Developer at ROSEN Group, shared insights on enhancing balcony power plants using Python. As plug-in solar systems gain popularity, the talk focused on understanding household energy consumption and optimizing power output. L\u00fcbbe highlighted the simplicity of installing balcony power plants without requiring an electrician. By utilizing devices like WiFi plugs from Shelly and myStrom with REST APIs, power consumption can be measured. Power production, ideally monitored using OpenDTU with compatible microinverters, can also be achieved using WiFi plugs. Recorded values are then published to Redis for observation via WebSockets and FastAPI. L\u00fcbbe emphasized the potential for pushing these values to a public server managed by FastAPI and Redis, with access control through social logins like Google or GitHub.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
