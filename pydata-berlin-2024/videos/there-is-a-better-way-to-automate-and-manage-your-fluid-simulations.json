Traditionally, shell scripts have been used for CAE automation, particularly in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), but they pose limitations. Data management is complex due to large simulation data sizes. Julian suggests using Python as an automation and glue language along with Data Version Control (DVC), built on git, to streamline workflows.\n\nHe demonstrates Python's versatility in CAE tasks like exporting CFD results to PowerPoint using python-pptx and optimizing electrical thermal simulations. Julian also showcases the adaptability of DVC beyond its machine learning roots for engineering applications. Benefits include managing simulations, comparing results, and creating meta studies effortlessly.\n\nThe talk is relevant for simulation engineers looking to enhance their workflows and software engineers keen on developing robust simulation tools. Julian also discusses the evolving CAE landscape and proposes enhancements for DVC. His practical examples and future outlook provide valuable insights for professionals in the simulation and engineering domains.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
