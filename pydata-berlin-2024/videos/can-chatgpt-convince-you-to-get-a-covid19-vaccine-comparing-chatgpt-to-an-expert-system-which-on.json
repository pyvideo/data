Her study unveiled a Python-based chatbot created in 2021 that successfully shifted 20% of participants' stances towards vaccination. Comparing this chatbot to advanced natural language processing technologies like ChatGPT, the research aimed to determine which system was more persuasive. Chatbots, as dialogical argumentation systems, offer a scalable and cost-effective option for behavior change applications, especially pertinent during public health crises. By examining the effectiveness of different systems, decisions can be made on resource allocation and selecting the most suitable platform to combat misinformation and facilitate informed decision-making in behavior change contexts.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
