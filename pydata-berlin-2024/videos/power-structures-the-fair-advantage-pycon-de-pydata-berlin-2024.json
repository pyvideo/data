She emphasized the importance of understanding human complexities, motivations, and informal networks in the workplace. Anja discussed how as developers, it's crucial to navigate through power dynamics, politics, and socio-technical aspects to effectively influence decision-making processes. She highlighted the significance of identifying key stakeholders and building trust within informal networks to drive projects forward. Anja stressed that while developers excel in formalizing solutions through code, understanding human behavior is equally essential for success in organizations.
