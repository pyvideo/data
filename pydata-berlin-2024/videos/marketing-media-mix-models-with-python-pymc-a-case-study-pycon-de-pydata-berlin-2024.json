Fabbiani highlighted the challenges faced in understanding marketing ROI in today's digital landscape with evolving privacy norms. The case study focused on how a Bayesian Marketing Media Mix model was developed for WeRoad, the fastest-growing Italian tour operator.\n\nThe utilization of a Bayesian model allowed for the incorporation of prior knowledge, enabling the system to generate robust insights by updating with new data. Fabbiani delved into the complexities of assessing the effectiveness of marketing channels such as online ads, social media, and promotions. Attendees gained insight into the design of the Bayesian model, including the incorporation of expert knowledge and modeling delays and saturation.\n\nThe technical implementation, powered by Python, PyMC, and Streamlit, was discussed, showcasing an effective, efficient, and user-friendly system. Participants walked away with a foundational understanding of the Bayesian approach, real-life examples of its impact on WeRoad's marketing strategy, and a blueprint for integrating predictive models into their own business strategies. This talk provided a practical roadmap for developing similar models to optimize marketing ROI in a privacy-centric digital environment.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
