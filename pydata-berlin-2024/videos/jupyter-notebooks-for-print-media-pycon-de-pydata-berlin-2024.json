The session introduces the nbprint library and showcases end-to-end examples. While Jupyter Notebooks are commonly used by researchers and data scientists for digital platforms, less attention has been paid to creating print media like newspaper articles and textbooks. Paine illustrates the benefits of adopting Jupyter Notebooks for print media through examples like data-driven news publications, computer science textbooks, and business reports. The talk also explores the technologies needed for producing print media from notebooks, focusing on NBPrint and paged.js. Additionally, Paine demonstrates a seamless transition from a Jupyter Notebook to a high-quality printed publication, emphasizing the advantages of this approach and identifying disciplines that could benefit from using notebooks as the foundation for print-oriented media.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
