  "description": "\ud83d\udd0a Recorded at PyCon DE & PyData Berlin 2024, 22.04.2024\nhttps://2024.pycon.de/program/NYHFSB/\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Watch Jon Nordby explain how to deploy machine learning models on microcontrollers using MicroPython and emlearn, enabling the creation of devices that can automatically analyze and react to physical phenomena in a cost-effective manner.\n\nSpeakers:\nJon Nordby\n\nDescription:\nIn the talk by Jon Nordby, Head of Data Science at Soundsensing, attendees will discover how to implement machine learning models on microcontroller-based systems using MicroPython and emlearn. This approach, known as \"TinyML,\" enables the creation of devices capable of analyzing and responding to real-world data captured by sensors like microphones, accelerometers, and cameras. The session will delve into training models with scikit-learn and Keras, and deploying them on devices using the emlearn library. By showcasing applications like Sound Event Detection, Image Classification, and Human Activity Recognition, Jon will illustrate the practicality and versatility of TinyML across various industries and consumer electronics segments.\n\nWith a focus on cost-effective microcontrollers that have become increasingly powerful, Jon will highlight the significance of efficiently utilizing limited resources like RAM and CPU time, a key aspect addressed by emlearn. This open-source Python library facilitates the conversion of machine learning models to efficient C code, ensuring seamless deployment on a wide array of microcontrollers that support C99 compilation. By integrating MicroPython, developers can leverage Python's familiar syntax to code applications for microcontrollers, streamlining the workflow and enhancing productivity. The models generated with emlearn deliver superior performance compared to pure-Python alternatives, paving the way for rapid and optimized model deployment in various applications, from vehicle detection to real-time malware identification.\n\nThroughout the presentation, the audience will gain insights into core machine learning concepts, while also exploring the convergence of Python, microcontrollers, and embedded systems\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
