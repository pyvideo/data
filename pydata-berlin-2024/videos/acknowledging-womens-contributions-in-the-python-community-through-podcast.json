They highlighted the need to recognize women's contributions and the impact of diversity in the community. Efforts such as PyCon US Charlas and PyLadies are improving diversity, yet women only make up 17% of guests on popular Python podcasts. Cheuk and Tereza launched a podcast to amplify women's voices and inspire others to support diversity in the Python community. They emphasized the influence of podcast guests and the importance of representation. The speakers shared data on gender representation in podcasts and showcased success stories from their own podcast series. They encouraged the audience to listen to diverse voices, promote inclusivity, and suggest interviews to further support underrepresented groups in the Python community.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
