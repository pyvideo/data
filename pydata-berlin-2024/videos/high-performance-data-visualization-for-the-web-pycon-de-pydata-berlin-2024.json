Perspective, written in C++ and Rust with bindings to Python and WebAssembly, offers various visualization plugins like datagrids and charts. Moreover, it includes a Jupyter widget for quick iteration towards production websites. The talk highlighted the scarcity of tools within the Python ecosystem capable of handling substantial streaming data and live aggregations, filtering, and sorting. Paine demonstrated setting up a website using Perspective, starting with static data on a FastAPI-based platform, showcasing pivotal features such as sorting, filtering, and cross-filtering. The audience learned how to integrate Perspective into their applications for static and streaming data, ranging from high-performance datagrids to interconnected visualization components.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
