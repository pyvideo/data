This innovation enables users to seamlessly embed Python code directly into Excel workbooks for advanced data analytics. Python in Excel leverages the Python Anaconda Distribution running in the Microsoft Cloud, granting immediate access to a wide array of packages essential for data science, visualization, and machine learning applications. The integration automatically integrates the output of Python code executions into the spreadsheet, providing interactive data reports that can be shared with ease. Currently available in public preview for all users on the MS Excel Beta Channel for Windows, Python in Excel offers limitless possibilities for data manipulation, validation, and visualization within the familiar Excel environment. The tutorial focused on exploring the various features and potentials of this integration, guiding attendees through executing Python code in Excel, and culminating in creating a complete machine learning experiment directly within Excel. Familiarity with Excel and Python is the minimal requirement for attendees to benefit from this tutorial. To set up Python in Excel, users need to join the Microsoft 365 Insider Program at the Beta Channel level and can enhance their experience by installing the Excel Labs plugin, which includes a Python editor for easier Python script authoring in Excel. To get hands-on experience, users can download the Financial Sample Excel Workbook provided by Microsoft.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
