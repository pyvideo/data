The session will guide participants through creating a real-time GenAI-powered application that operates offline, ensuring data privacy. Attendees will learn to construct a live streaming voice-to-text transcription pipeline along with an LLM-based conversation summarization layer. The presentation will include a practical demonstration using open-source Python libraries such as Streamlit for the frontend and Django for the backend. The talk is tailored for Python enthusiasts, requiring no prior ML expertise, and aims to empower attendees to design personalized, specialized tools for their unique needs. By demonstrating the simplicity of building LLM-based applications, John will inspire the audience to explore the vast possibilities offered by open-source AI components. Attendees can expect engaging live demos, plenty of Python code, and GitHub resources for hands-on experimentation. The talk will showcase the ease of integrating various tools like Whisper for transcription, LangChain for summarization, and Django for web API, highlighting the accessibility and versatility of modern open-source AI solutions.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
