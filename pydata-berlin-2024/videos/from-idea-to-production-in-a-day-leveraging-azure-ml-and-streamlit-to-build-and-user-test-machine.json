In his talk, Florian emphasized the significance of experimentation and user testing in driving innovation. Drawing from his experience in corporate hackathons, he highlighted the challenges faced by data science teams in deploying user-facing machine learning solutions quickly.\n\nFlorian showcased a practical approach to leverage Azure Machine Learning, automated machine learning, and Streamlit for rapid prototyping. He demonstrated building a computer vision system for identifying trash in images using the TACO dataset. By employing Azure ML to evaluate the model and ONNX for model deployment, he illustrated how Streamlit can be used to create an interactive application for users to upload images and perform trash identification.\n\nBy sharing code snippets and technical know-how, Florian aimed to empower fellow data scientists to expedite their development process, fostering quicker experimentation and innovation in product development. The methodology presented in his talk allows for the swift integration of machine learning into core product offerings, showcasing the potential for rapid progress in the data science domain.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
