  "description": "\ud83d\udd0a Recorded at PyCon DE & PyData Berlin 2024, 23.04.2024\nhttps://2024.pycon.de/program/RGWDCN/\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Watch how Pydantic's Data Validation can revolutionize your configuration management system, catch misconfigurations early, and streamline your application's development process.\n\nSpeakers:\nPhilipp Stephan\n\nDescription:\nPhilipp Stephan discusses the challenges of managing configuration in growing applications and introduces `Pydantic`'s data validation capabilities. By transitioning their system from unstructured YAML to a formalized, typed system, they reduced runtime errors and improved consistency across parsers. `Pydantic` integrates well with Python's type annotations, allowing for early misconfiguration detection. The speaker highlights the benefits of a strict specification, such as static validation, automatic documentation generation, and centralized defaults. They explain the decision to use `Pydantic` over other systems, given its popularity in the Python community, especially in `FastAPI`. Stephan shares tips for setting up configuration files and internal tools for validation and documentation. The talk emphasizes the incremental transition to a class-based, type-strict system empowered by `Pydantic`.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
