By leveraging GenAI, specifically ChatGPT for tailored prompts and image retrieval and DALL-E 3 for location verification, they have automated the process. The pipeline involves querying free stock image services, using landmarks to ensure images represent cities accurately, and adjusting resolutions for diverse platforms. This cost-efficient approach has enabled Flix to enhance customer experience with inspiring city photos for their extensive bus network. The talk outlined the three main steps of their pipeline, sharing insights on challenges faced, results achieved across various countries, and the potential future improvements with upcoming cutting-edge models. This illustrates how GenAI can be utilized beyond creative tasks to analyze and filter publicly available information for businesses efficiently.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
