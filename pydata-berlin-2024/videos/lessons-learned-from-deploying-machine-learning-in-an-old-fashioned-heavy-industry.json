With the aim to decarbonize the cement and concrete supply chain, alcemy leverages data intelligence and predictive Machine Learning control to optimize production processes. Meyer emphasized the importance of simple, interpretable ML models like random forests over complex architectures, highlighting the necessity of data quality for effective ML outcomes. The challenges of working with customer-provided data, discrepancies between training and real-time inference data, and the significance of understanding customer processes were discussed in detail. Meyer also shed light on the complexities of customer relations in the context of Machine Learning, emphasizing the need for a strong customer success team in addition to skilled ML engineers. Furthermore, he emphasized the differences between Machine Learning as a service and a software as a service business model, underscoring the challenges of onboarding customers and integrating with existing infrastructure in heavy industry. Meyer's talk provided valuable lessons for aspiring ML engineers, Data Scientists, and entrepreneurs interested in real-world applications of Machine Learning in unconventional sectors.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
