By using a single file Django project, developers can create asynchronous microservices with ease. The concept of lightweight Django projects has been around for a while, initially appearing in the book \"Lightweight Django\" in 2014. However, it wasn't until Django introduced ASGI in 2022 that it became viable for microservices.\n\nDanilov discussed the benefits of Django microservices, such as the all-in-one package, standard architecture, and rapid development speed. He also highlighted challenges faced, including misconceptions about Django's suitability for microservices, issues with settings.py, and concerns about URL routing and performance.\n\nThe talk aimed to educate the audience about uDjango, a technology for building synchronous and asynchronous microservices using one or two files. Drawing inspiration from various industry experts and projects, Danilov emphasized the simplicity and efficiency of using uDjango for high-performance microservices.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
