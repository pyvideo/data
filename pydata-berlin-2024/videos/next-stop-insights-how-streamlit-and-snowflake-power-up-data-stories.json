  "description": "\ud83d\udd0a Recorded at PyCon DE & PyData Berlin 2024, 22.04.2024\nhttps://2024.pycon.de/program/83ZGV3/\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Watch the presentation to discover how Streamlit and Snowflake come together to power up engaging data stories with real-world insights from Deutsche Bahn's datasets!\n\nSpeakers:\nMarie-Kristin Wirsching\n\nDescription:\nMarie-Kristin Wirsching, a Data Scientist at inovex GmbH, presents on the power of Streamlit and Snowflake in enhancing data stories. Data stories are crucial in translating complex insights into actionable narratives for business value. Streamlit, an open-source Python package, simplifies the creation of interactive data dashboards. Since September 2023, Streamlit has been integrated into Snowflake, providing developers the ability to securely build, deploy, and share apps within Snowflake's data cloud, leveraging its scale, performance, and security.\n\nThe talk showcases a proof-of-concept using Deutsche Bahn's open-source dataset on Wi-Fi connectivity in trains to develop a data story implemented through a Streamlit app in Snowflake. Attendees will gain insights into utilizing Streamlit within Snowflake, creating data stories, and implementing Streamlit apps in Snowflake. This talk caters to data enthusiasts looking to present data insights effectively, construct appealing data applications effortlessly, and explore the synergy between Streamlit and Snowflake.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
