She emphasizes the importance of the open-source model ecosystem and dispels misconceptions about the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in industry.\n\nMontani highlights that principles of software development such as modularity, testability, and flexibility still hold significant value in the era of LLMs. She showcases practical real-world examples to demonstrate how open-source solutions can offer more transparency and control compared to proprietary systems controlled by tech giants.\n\nBy advocating for a focus on creating systems that align with specific requirements rather than relying on one-size-fits-all solutions offered by large models, Montani encourages the audience to leverage more efficient and manageable AI systems. She empowers developers to question the narrative pushed by big tech companies and instead adopt a mindset that prioritizes explicit functionalities over implicit processes and favors flexible building blocks over monolithic black box solutions.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
