  "description": "\ud83d\udd0a Recorded at PyCon DE & PyData Berlin 2024, 23.04.2024\nhttps://2024.pycon.de/program/CY97LS/\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Watch a fascinating analysis on the Austrian COVID-19 protest movement using geo-social media data to unveil the network structure, spatial hotspots, and dominant content themes through multi-dimensional network analysis.\n\nSpeakers:\nNefta Kanilmaz\n\nDescription:\nNefta Kanilmaz, a researcher and PhD candidate at the University of Salzburg, discussed a multidimensional approach to analyzing COVID-19 protest movements using geo-social media data. The talk focused on the use of publicly available social media data to understand the geographical centers of activity, network structure, and key themes of conspiracy movements. Kanilmaz presented a multi-dimensional network analysis for the Austrian COVID-19 protest movement, utilizing Python libraries such as geopandas, networkx, and gensim. The analysis included identifying geo-spatial hot spots, densely connected clusters, and dominating content themes through spatial statistics, community detection techniques, and topic modeling approaches respectively. The presentation underscored the importance of data-driven analysis in understanding movements that may threaten democracy, emphasizing the significance of publicly available social media data in addressing societal challenges. Python libraries employed in the analysis included geopandas, networkx, berttopic, lda, and others.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
