Despite Python never being the primary choice for Android development, recent developments, such as \u201cPEP 738: Adding Android as a supported platform,\u201d have made it a viable option. Shyamnath compares the three frameworks by showcasing a Contact List application, outlining their pros and cons to help developers choose the best fit for their needs. The talk covers the relevance of Android for Python developers, the current state of Android app development with Python, and specific demonstrations of developing the Contact List application using Kivy, PySide6, and Flet. Shyamnath also explores Python packages supported by each framework, providing a comprehensive overview for attendees to engage in a Q&A session for additional insights.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
