  "description": "\ud83d\udd0a Recorded at PyCon DE & PyData Berlin 2024, 22.04.2024\nhttps://2024.pycon.de/program/YWUZW9/\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Watch Dr. Juan Orduz introduce the innovative Hilbert Space Gaussian Process (HSGP) approximation method, enabling scalable and precise Gaussian process applications in time series analysis and Bayesian methods.\n\nSpeakers:\nDr. Juan Orduz\n\nDescription:\nDr. Juan Orduz, a Mathematician and Data Scientist, introduces the audience to a novel technique called the Hilbert Space Gaussian Process (HSGP) approximation. This method leverages spectral analysis to efficiently approximate Gaussian processes. By utilizing this approach, practitioners can effectively handle and adjust Gaussian processes at scale for various real-world applications. Through a hands-on demonstration using Numpyro, the talk elucidates the fundamental concepts behind the HSGP approximation method. Dr. Orduz demonstrates its practical implications by showcasing its implementation in Numpyro and PyMC for two distinct applications: time-varying coefficient regression and time series forecasting.\nThe key insight underlying this innovative approach is the use of Laplacian's spectral decomposition to approximate the spectral measures of kernels based on basis functions. A noteworthy aspect is that the basis functions in the reduced-rank approximation are independent of the hyperparameters of the covariance function, leading to significant computational efficiency gains. For further exploration, interested individuals can refer to various resources, such as research articles on reduced-rank Gaussian process regression and practical Bayesian Gaussian processes in probabilistic programming. Additionally, a tutorial example on Hilbert space approximation for Gaussian processes is available on the Numpyro website. Those seeking a visual guide can also watch the PyMCon Web Series featuring Bill Engels discussing the introduction of Hilbert Space GPs in PyMC.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
