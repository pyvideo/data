  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - How we are making Python 3.11 faster - presented by Mark Shannon\n\n[The Auditorium on 2022-07-14]\n\n\nThe \"Faster CPython\" project aims to speed up Python, specifically CPython, by a large factor over the next few releases.\nThe first release to see the benefits of this work is Python 3.11.\n\nPython 3.11 includes the following major changes:\n\n* Adaptive specializing interpreter (PEP 659)\n* Consecutively allocated execution frames\n* Zero cost try-except\n* More regular object layout\n* Lazily created object dictionaries.\n\nI will describe each of these, describing how each helps speed up Python, and how they interact with each other.\n\nI will end the talk with some possible directions for Python 3.12.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
