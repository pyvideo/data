  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - LocalStack: Turbocharging dev loops and team collaboration for cloud applications - presented by Waldemar Hummer\n\n[Wicklow Hall 1 on 2022-07-13]\n\n\nWith the staggering dominance of public cloud providers, dev teams across the globe are increasingly focusing time and energy on optimizing their cloud development and deployment flows. The traditional deploy-and-test cycles against public clouds can become slow and tedious, where developers are often facing several minutes of idle times between deployments that need to be frequently triggered during testing & debugging.\n\nIn this session, we provide a hands-on introduction to LocalStack (39k+ Github stars), a fully functional local AWS cloud stack. With LocalStack, applications can be developed entirely on your local machine, reducing dev&test cycles from minutes to seconds.\n\nThe session covers interactive live coding to showcase common scenarios and use cases, different settings for local debugging of Lambdas and containerized apps (e.g., ECS/EKS), as well as some advanced new features that can radically improve productivity and team collaboration patterns.\nWe will also glance over the large ecosystem of tools that LocalStack natively integrates with - from IaC frameworks like Terraform or Pulumi, to application frameworks like Serverless or Architect, to a whole suite of tools provided by AWS itself (CDK, SAM, Copilot, Chalice, etc).\n\nWe'll wrap up the session with a deep dive into some of the Python internals of LocalStack, which reveals some interesting architectural patterns and hidden gems!\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
