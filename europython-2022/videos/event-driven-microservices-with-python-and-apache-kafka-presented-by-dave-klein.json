  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - Event-driven microservices with Python and Apache Kafka - presented by Dave Klein\n\n[Wicklow Hall 1 on 2022-07-13]\n\n\nBuilding distributed systems can be challenging, and that's what microservices are. With traditional request/response based architectures, it is easy to end up with services that are tightly coupled, making them difficult to maintain and extend independently. While not a silver bullet, an event-based architecture makes it easier to maintain loose coupling. It also makes it easier to extend and evolve our systems without resorting to a rewrite. \n\nIn this presentation, we will look at an example of an event-driven microservices application and discuss some things to consider when adopting this approach.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
