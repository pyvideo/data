  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - Automate cleaning code in few easy steps! - presented by Ester\n\n[The Auditorium on 2022-07-14]\n\n\nHave you ever been in a situation where you check your pipelines to see if he\u2019s finished running the tests and you find that he hasn\u2019t even started because you forgot to run the linters locally?\n\nI contribute to the development of PyCon Italia (https://pycon.it), Strawberry GraphQL (https://strawberry.rocks) and Poetry Package Manager and coding with these organizations I discovered fantastic tools such as pre-commit (https://pre-commit.com/), Poetry (https://python-poetry.org) and many others. In this talk I would like to share with you my findings, think about the pros and cons and understand a little bit better why you should start using them.\n\nSlides available here: https://www.slideshare.net/EsterBeltrami1/automate-cleaning-code-in-few-easy-steps\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
