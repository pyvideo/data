  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - Keynote: Dodging AI Dystopia: you can't save the world alone - presented by Dr. Nakeema Stefflbauer\n\n[The Auditorium on 2022-07-13]\n\n\nIf real life was a superhero movie, we\u2019d have all the ingredients needed for a hero\u2019s rescue. So many \u201cAI\u201d algorithms are being applied to EU education, employment, and public safety systems that you might wonder if the TV series \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d is fiction or a blueprint for nefarious actors. Luckily, there are codes to keep dystopia at bay, whether from the fictional Justice League or from real-life courts of justice. This talk discusses both, and is aimed at software engineers, architects, designers, testers and product/project managers who want to slow the Automation of Everything, but don\u2019t know how.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
