In this talk I will introduce you to both concepts (ABCs and Protocols), and show you by example how they can make your life easier, and your code cleaner.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
