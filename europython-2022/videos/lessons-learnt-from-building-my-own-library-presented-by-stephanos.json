  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - Lessons learnt from building my own library - presented by Stephanos\n\n[Liffey B on 2022-07-14]\n\n\nThis talk is about all the mistakes that I made while building a library, how I would have avoided making them if I started today, what turns I would have taken differently, what choices I made, and why I made them. Examples are drawn from the building of a specific library, but it's not about a specific one. \n\nThe aim is to give some insights more into how to make choices when building a library available to the world, and less on the specific set of choices that I made.\n\nIt will not be technically challenging, but some familiarity with the Python ecosystem is advised.\"\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
