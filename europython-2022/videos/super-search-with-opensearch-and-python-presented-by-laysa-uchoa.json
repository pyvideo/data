  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - Super Search with OpenSearch and Python - presented by Laysa Uchoa\n\n[The Auditorium on 2022-07-15]\n\n\nOpenSearch is an open source and free document database with search and aggregation superpowers, based on Elasticsearch. This session covers how to use OpenSearch to perform both simple and advanced searches on semi-structured data such as a product database. Search is pretty useful inside applications, so we'll also discuss how to connect to OpenSearch from existing Python applications, work with data in the database, and perform search and aggregation queries from Python. This talk is recommended for Python developers whose applications are ready to gain some search superpowers.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
