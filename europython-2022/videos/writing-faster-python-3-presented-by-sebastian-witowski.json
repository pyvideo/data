  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - Writing Faster Python 3 - presented by Sebastian Witowski\n\n[The Auditorium on 2022-07-14]\n\n\nDid you know that Python preallocates integers from -5 to 257? Reusing them 1000 times, instead of allocating memory for a bigger integer, can save you a couple milliseconds of code\u2019s execution time. If you want to learn more about this kind of optimizations then, \u2026 well, probably this presentation is not for you :) Instead of going into such small details, I will talk about more \u201csane\u201d ideas for writing faster code.\n\nAfter a brief overview of different levels of optimization and how they work in Python, I will show you simple and fast ways of measuring the execution time of your code and finally, discuss examples of how some code structures could be improved.\n\nYou will see:\n\n* The fastest way of removing duplicates from a list\n* How much faster your code is when you reuse the built-in functions instead of trying to reinvent the wheel\n* What is faster than the \u201cfor loop\u201d\n* If the lookup is faster in a list or a set\n* When it\u2019s better to beg for forgiveness than to ask for permission\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
