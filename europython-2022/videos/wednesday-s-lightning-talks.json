The queue is reset every day in the morning.\nYou may talk about / present (almost) everything with certain boundaries:\n- no promotion for products of companies, no call for 'we are hiring' (but you may name your employer).\n- conference announcements are limited to one minute only\n- one LT per person per conference policy: everyone who has not given an LT at this year's conference, yet, is ahead of you in the queue\n- keep it short, the shorter the presentations, the more people can give a talk\n\nSee you there and have fun!\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
