Let\u2019s be real here: documentation is often an afterthought and rarely included in life cycle development processes. Still, documentation is the secret weapon for greater adoption, and growth that you may have not known you could achieve.\n\nIt\u2019s time for you to step up your game and measure up to the big players. Learn about the benefits of high quality and educational documentation and the true role it plays in the developer community. You\u2019ll also learn the principles of a solid foundation, and tips on how to use one of the most powerful developer relations\u2019 tools.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
