  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - Native Packaging of GUI Apps on Windows and macOS - presented by Tiago Montes\n\n[Liffey Hall 1 on 2022-07-15]\n\n\nDistributing Python GUI applications to end users is a challenge: will they need to install Python? If so, which version? If not, how do they install the application? From a random ZIP file? How native does the process feel? Will their system trust your code? For a fluid experience, it needs to be signed and (on macOS) notarized beforehand.\n\nWelcome to `pup` (https://pypi.org/project/pup/), the tool that the Mu Editor (https://codewith.mu/) development team has created to package and distribute it in platform-native formats to Windows and macOS users around the world.\n\nIn this session I will show how `pup` can be used to package GUI Applications for distribution: natively on Windows and macOS, and in early stages of development for distribution-agnostic Linux artifacts. In short, if it's `pip`-installable it is `pup`-packageable!\n\nI will then describe the way `pup` works (and how it differs from comparable tools) leading on to a call-for-action moment, where I'll share its current state of development, what's good, what's bad, and where I'd like it to be headed to.\n\nI'll wrap up the talk with a set of future-looking thoughts that `pup` has helped identify not only on the specifics of CPython's distribution, but also on the Python ecosystem as whole.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
