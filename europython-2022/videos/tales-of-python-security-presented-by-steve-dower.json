  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - Tales of Python Security - presented by Steve Dower\n\n[Liffey B on 2022-07-15]\n\n\nIn this session, you'll learn about recent security issues in CPython and the core parts of our ecosystem. You'll hear about the process by which they were filed, how they were reviewed, analysed, shared (when appropriate), resolved and ultimately disclosed to the public.\n\nAs well as real stories of security vulnerabilities, you'll learn how you can help by responsibly reporting potential issues, and how to protect yourself against common risks, as well as the best ways to find out about major issues and how to respond.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
