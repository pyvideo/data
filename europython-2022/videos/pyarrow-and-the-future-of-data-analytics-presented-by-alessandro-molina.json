  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - PyArrow and the future of data analytics - presented by Alessandro Molina\n\n[Liffey Hall 1 on 2022-07-14]\n\n\nIn this talk we will introduce PyArrow and talk bout the transformation that the Arrow format is allowing in the Data Analytics world.\n\nPyArrow provides an in-memory format, a disk format, a network exchange protocol, a dataframe library and a query engine all integrated in a single library. But the Arrow ecosystem doesn't stop there and allows you to work integrating multiple different technologies. It can be a swiss army knife for data engineers and it integrates zero cost with NumPy and Pandas in many cases.\"\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
