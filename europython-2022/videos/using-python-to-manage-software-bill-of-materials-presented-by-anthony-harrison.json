  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - Using Python to manage Software Bill of Materials - presented by Anthony Harrison\n\n[Wicklow Hall 1 on 2022-07-13]\n\n\nSoftware has become increasingly complex as it is constructed from a multitude of software components. In many cases the identification of these components are hidden as they are included through implicit dependencies. Without fully understanding the dependencies of your product it is not possible to understand the current vulnerability status of your software product or system.\nIn the past 12 months, there has been an increasing focus on the use Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) as a key artefact to be delivered with a software product; it will be mandated for all software products in some markets later in 2022. SBOMs which were initially developed to capture the inter-dependencies between components (the focus was on capturing the different types of open source licences used within a product) but with the latest evolution, tracking of vulnerabilities within a product can now be performed.\n\nThis talk will introduce the SBOM concept and show how Python and its ecosystem can be used to create, manage and use SBOMs as part of your development pipeline.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
