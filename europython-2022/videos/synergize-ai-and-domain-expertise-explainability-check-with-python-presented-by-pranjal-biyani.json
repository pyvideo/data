  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - Synergize AI and Domain Expertise - Explainability Check with Python - presented by Pranjal Biyani\n\n[Liffey Hall 1 on 2022-07-14]\n\n\nWe will go through the Why? How? and What? of Model Explainability to build consistent, robust and trustworthy models. We explore the inability of complex models to deliver meaningful insights, cause-effect relationships and inter-connected effects within data and how explainers can empower decision makers with more than just predictions. We evaluate an intuitive game-theory based algorithm, SHAP, with a working implementation in Python. We will also pin-point intersections necessary with domain experts with 2 practical industry applications to facilitate further exploration.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
