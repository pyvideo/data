  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - PySnooper: Never use print for debugging again - presented by Ram Rachum\n\n[Liffey A on 2022-07-13]\n\n\nI had an idea for a debugging solution for Python that doesn't require complicated configuration like PyCharm. I released PySnooper as a cute little open-source project that does that, and to my surprise, it became a huge hit overnight, hitting the top of Hacker News, r/python and GitHub trending.\nIn this talk I'll go into:\n\n* How PySnooper can help you debug your code.\n* How you can write your own debugging / code intelligence tools.\n* How to make your open-source project go viral.\n* How to use PuDB, another debugging solution, to find bugs in your code.\"\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
