  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - Unfolding the paper windmills - presented by Mai Gim\u00e9nez\n\n[Liffey Hall 2 on 2022-07-15]\n\n\nResearch is done on the shoulders of giants. Luckily and unluckily, those giants spoke paper-English and documented their achievements kind of publicly so we could advance the science. \n\nIn this talk, we will dissect the structure of a paper, looking for the essential points that will help us understand it and implement it. Following we will get our hands dirty and implement the paper using Python. \nIn particular, we will dive into the seminal paper \"\"Attention is all you need\"\" and implement a transformer using JAX.\n\nThe key takeaways from this talk are:\n - Demystify academic reading.\n - Understand the Transformer architecture.\n - An introduction to the JAX ecosystem.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
