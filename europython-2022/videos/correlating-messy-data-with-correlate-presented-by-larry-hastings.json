What could be more computer science-y! Ever needed to find matching items between two sets of data? Maybe even messy real-world data, with inexact string matches? Come find out how the novel scoring algorithm and clever heuristics at the heart of **correlate** solve this problem with ease!\"\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
