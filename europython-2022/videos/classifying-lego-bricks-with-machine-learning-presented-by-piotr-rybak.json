  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - Classifying LEGO Bricks with Machine Learning - presented by Piotr Rybak\n\n[Liffey Hall 1 on 2022-07-13]\n\n\nDuring this talk, I will walk you through my journey to create the Lego bricks recognition application in Python. I will start with dataset creation and introduce some Lego-specific concepts and resources. Then, I will explain a few different Machine Learning approaches to solve Lego bricks recognition task \u2013 classification, detection, and metric learning. Finally, I will show what has worked, what hasn\u2019t, and how you can play with it yourself.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
