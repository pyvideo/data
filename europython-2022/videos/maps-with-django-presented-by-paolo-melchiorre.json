  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - Maps with Django - presented by Paolo Melchiorre\n\n[Wicklow Hall 1 on 2022-07-14]\n\n\nA _map_ in a website is the best way to make geographic data easily accessible to users because it represents, in a simple way, the information relating to a specific geographical area and is in fact used by many online services.\n\nImplementing a web _map_ can be complex and many adopt the strategy of using external services, but in most cases this strategy turns out to be a major data and cost management problem.\n\nIn this talk we'll see how to create a web _map_ with the *Python* based web framework *Django* using its *GeoDjango* module, storing geographic data in your local database on which to run geospatial queries.\n\nThrough this intervention you can learn how to add a _map_ on your website, starting from a simple _map_ based on Spatialite/SQLite up to a more complex and interactive _map_ based on PostGIS/PostgreSQL.\n\nSlides: https://www.paulox.net/2022/07/14/europython-2022/\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
