  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - When gRPC met Python - presented by Sanket Singh\n\n[Wicklow Hall 1 on 2022-07-14]\n\n\ngRPC is one of the most new breakthroughs in the world of client server interaction. Using gRPC our client can directly make a call to a server on a different machine as if it were a local object. gRPC has low latency, high scalability and supports multiple use cases for distributed system. We can even build mobile clients which can communicate to a cloud server. gRPC uses Protocol Buffers which is an open source mechanism for serializing structured data, which makes payloads faster, smaller and simpler. In this talk we will try to understand how can we get started with gRPC in Python. grpcio package of python will be used for the demonstration of the examples and we will cover basics of gRPC as well. We will build a basic gRPC service and define protocol buffers for it. Demonstration of how a client and a server can be made through gRPC and how can they communicate.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
