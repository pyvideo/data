  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - Scalpel: The Python Static Analysis Framework - presented by Jiawei Wang\n\n[The Auditorium on 2022-07-14]\n\n\nScalpel is a Python Static Analysis Framework. It provides essential program analysis functions for facilitating the implementation of client applications focusing on statically resolving dedicated problems.\n\nWe aim to provide Scalpel as a generic Python static analysis framework that includes as many functions as possible (e.g., to easily build inter-function control-flow graph, to interpret the import relationship of different Python modules, etc.) towards facilitating developers to implement their dedicated problem-focused static analyzers. \n\nScalpel\u2019s Github page has received around 100 stars from researchers and practitioners around the world in only three-month after being made public.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
