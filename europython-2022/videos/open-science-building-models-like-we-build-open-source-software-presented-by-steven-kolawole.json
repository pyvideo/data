  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - Open Science: Building Models LIke We Build Open-Source Software - presented by Steven Kolawole\n\n[Liffey Hall 1 on 2022-07-14]\n\n\nHere, I elaborate on why we should develop tools that will allow us to build pre-trained models in the same way that we build open-source software. Specifically, models should be developed by a large community of stakeholders who continually update and improve them. Realizing this goal will require porting many ideas from open-source software development to building and training models, which motivates many threads of interesting research and opens up machine learning research for much larger participation.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
