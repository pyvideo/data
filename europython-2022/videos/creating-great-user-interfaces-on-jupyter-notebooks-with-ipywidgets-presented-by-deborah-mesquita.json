  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - Creating great user interfaces on Jupyter Notebooks with ipywidgets - presented by Deborah Mesquita\n\n[Liffey Hall 2 on 2022-07-14]\n\n\nA useful Jupyter notebook that takes input from the user to generate results is a great candidate to become a web application, but usually data scientists don't have the front-end skills required to build one and deploy them. Using notebooks with ipywidgets can be a great solution to build teams' internal tools because we get the user-friendly widgets and don't need to worry about the deployment since it's all in Jupyter.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
