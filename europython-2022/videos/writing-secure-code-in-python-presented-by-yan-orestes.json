  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - Writing secure code in Python - presented by Yan Orestes\n\n[Liffey B on 2022-07-15]\n\n\nIs your Python code secure? This talk will show how some inattentions, mistakes and assumptions that we, as developers, carry in our code can lead to serious vulnerabilities in our applications. All of that, of course, with lots of examples! At the end, the talk will present a simple way to audit Python code in order to facilitate the maintenance of your security with the identification of possible vulnerabilities.\n\n- Learn how `eval()`, pickle, and pip are vulnerable to arbitrary code execution\n- Understand the importance of cryptographically-secure randomness\n- Learn how to audit your code and keep your programs secure\n- ... and more!\"\n\nLicence: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
