  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - Saving Lives with Predictive Geo - AI - presented by Sumedh Ghatage\n\n[Liffey Hall 2 on 2022-07-15]\n\n\nWe will demonstrate an end-to-end methodology using geospatial Python libraries to understand the use of Multi-Criteria Decision making methods taking into account driving variables. This talk will also throw light upon:\n\n1. Getting the large imagery datasets into DL friendly format\n2. Resampling of Satellite image data in python\n3. Conducting overlay analysis with weights\n4. Calculation of zonal statistics at house level\n5. Future Scope\n\nWe'll also showcase the geo-visualization portal we created and the technologies used, how you can use Python to convert large GeoJSON output to light vector tiles, and create a seamless experience for the user through an intuitive front-end.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
