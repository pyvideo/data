  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - The Design of Everyday APIs - presented by Lynn Root\n\n[Liffey B on 2022-07-13]\n\n\nWhat makes a good API for a library? Or more importantly, what makes it bad?\n\nImplementing an API is an art. It\u2019s the connection between the user and the library itself. How can we optimize that connection to make the experience more pleasing? What makes a user reach for one library over another? What goes into an ergonomic API?\n\nThis talk will first discuss what makes an API good: documentation, simplicity, consistency, completeness, and flexibility. We will apply those elements by looking at developing and iterating on our own library.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
