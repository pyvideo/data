  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - Handling Errors the Graceful Way in Python - presented by Riya Bansal\n\n[Liffey B on 2022-07-15]\n\n\nIn the process of programming, we are always going to encounter various errors. \nThings rarely go as planned, especially in the world of programming. Errors are unavoidable when writing code, which can be frustrating at times. Every single one of us has faced this issue and emerged from it a better programmer. Dealing with bugs and errors is what builds our confidence in the long run and teaches us valuable lessons along the way.\nSo, in this talk, we'll discuss different ways of handling errors and making our lives a little better. \nWe'll talk about how code written with effective exception handling strategies can help us to catch bugs early in the software developmental cycle.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
