Nothing has been the same since. Transitioning and the events leading up to it changed my life, and the experiences I had during my transition changed me as a person, and as a leader.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to open up about this period in my life, not just because it comes with tremendous vulnerability, not just because it\u2019s very personal, but also because it has been the hardest few months in my life. The decisions I faced were far more consequential and way harder to grapple than any decisions I had to make as a leader or any time during my professional career. However I feel that other people \u2014 people who will never go through anything like I did \u2014 can learn from my story a lot exactly because it has been a very unusual and difficult problem to solve.\"\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
