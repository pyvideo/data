  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - Creating the Next Generation of Billionaires - Part 4 - presented by Lilian\n\n[Liffey B on 2022-07-14]\n\n\nOur generation of young people in school (aged 5-18) have noticed the connection between Computer pRogramming, Technology, Bitcoinism Success, Climate Change and Billionaires.\n\nOn mass young people are clamouring to master the skill of Computer pRogramming. It has been dubbed the \u20184th\u2019 R\u2019 (computer pRogramming) along with Reading, wRiting and aRithmetic. So, governments worldwide have launched initiatives to have it taught in schools from Kindergarten to all the way to high school. And now young people are successfully mastering this skill.\n\nThis talk will describe a case study whereby Computer Programming (Python) was introduced for the first time to a group of young people and how the young people are using it to explore and understand real world problems and data such as those relating to climate change, world population growth and carbon dioxide emissions with Python visualisation libraries such as Matplotlib, Numpy and Pandas. We will talk about the joys and challenges and discoveries made by the young people. We will conclude with suggestions on how to proceed in this area.\"\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
