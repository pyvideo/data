Moderation platforms need to support multiple typologies like - hate, sexually explicit, violence, bullying, spam and other toxic material. Add multi-language support for all typologies and it becomes an uphill task. In this talk we will cover the below topics:\n\n1. Why is Text Content Moderation is hard? Why we need AI?\n2. What are the available open-source datasets to train models?\n3. What are the available pre-trained models for content moderation?\n4. Why pre-trained models do not always work?\n5. Data labelling strategies and how to leverage open data and models?\n6. How to build multi-language support and challenges?\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
