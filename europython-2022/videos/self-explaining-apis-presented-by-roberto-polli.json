  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - Self-explaining APIs - presented by Roberto Polli\n\n[Liffey A on 2022-07-14]\n\n\nThis talk will present strategies and python tools to create semantically interoperable REST APIs. After the problem statement, various solutions will be presented, including:\n\n* contract-first api development with OpenAPI 3, ontologies and controlled vocabularies like the ones published by the European Union (https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/authority-tables);\n* the rdflib and pyld python libraries for processing json-ld and RDF files (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework);\n* the use of centralized catalogs such as schema.org.\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n* no prior knowledge of semantics and ontologies;\n* practical experience with OpenAPI, json schema and data modeling and API design in general.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
