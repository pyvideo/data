  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - CPython bugs & risky features - presented by disconnect3d\n\n[The Auditorium on 2022-07-13]\n\n\nIn this talk we will look into a few bug cases or doubtful features in CPython some of which are still present (and known to bugs.python.org) and may impose a security risk for admins or organizations.\n\nWe will learn why running Python interpreter in random directory can be harmful which is related to interpreter libs loading, a possibility for installed modules to inject code into any Python script execution (even if the installed library is not imported), a socket.inet_aton issue that actually comes from glibc and risks involved with those cases and possible mitigations of those risks.\n\n@EDIT After talk:\n- Watch the talk on https://youtu.be/tRtxCCRdZOs?t=12251\n- Slides are available on https://ujeb.se/pybugs\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
