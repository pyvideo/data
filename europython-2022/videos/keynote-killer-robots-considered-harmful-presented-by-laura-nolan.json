  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - Keynote: Killer Robots Considered Harmful - presented by Laura Nolan\n\n[The Auditorium on 2022-07-14]\n\n\nKiller robots may sound like something from a movie, but in recent years weapons have been developed that can select targets and attack without any human input, and expert systems have been used to assist in military targeting.\n\nSome argue that this is a positive development, because automation can increase precision in targeting and reduce civilian casualties. However, others point out that highly automated systems do not have a good track record in complex and high-stakes real-world situations, and military conflict is unlikely to be better.\n\nThis talk will outline the technological underpinnings of autonomous weapons and automated targeting systems, as well as examining the legal and ethical debate over these systems that has been happening at the UN over the past decade.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
