  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - Mercury - Build & Share Data Apps from Jupyter Notebook - presented by Piotr P\u0142o\u0144ski\n\n[Liffey Hall 2 on 2022-07-15]\n\n\nThe Mercury (https://github.com/mljar/mercury) is a new framework for converting Jupyter Notebook to a web app. The widgets are constructed based on the YAML config (similar to R Markdown). The user can tweak the values of the widgets and execute the notebook from the top to the bottom. The notebook sharing is as simple as sending a link. What is more, you can decide whether to show or hide the code.\n\nIn the talk, I would like to show how the Python notebook can be converted to a web app and deployed to the cloud.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
