  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - I have to Confess, I still Love Pandas - presented by Cheuk Ting Ho\n\n[Liffey Hall 1 on 2022-07-13]\n\n\nIn this talk, Cheuk will reapproach Pandas as someone who is a fluent user of the library. Cheuk will review why Pandas is useful to work with data and what advantage it has over the alternatives methods. As Pandas has many functionalities, Cheuk will dissect the discussion on the potential usage of Pandas in day-to-day data science workflow: data inspection, data cleaning, feature engineering etc.\n\nAfter discussing the advantage of using Pandas, Cheuk will discuss the flip side. What makes Pandas a difficult tool to use at first. Here Cheuk will share how she used it efficiently with new users and some fundamental concepts about Pandas.\n\nThis talk is for Pandas users (new and old) or potential users. Those who are familiar with Pandas may get a refreshing idea from a new angle about the tool. And for the new users, it will be a good startup guide to make the journey of using it a bit easier.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
