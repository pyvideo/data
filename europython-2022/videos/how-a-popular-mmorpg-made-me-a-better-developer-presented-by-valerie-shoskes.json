  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - How a popular MMORPG made me a better developer - presented by Valerie Shoskes\n\n[Wicklow Hall 1 on 2022-07-15]\n\n\nThis talk will have special meaning for Final Fantasy fans, but anyone with nerdy non-coding hobbies should be able to enjoy it. The intended outcome is for attendees to see their own hobbies in a new light, where they can find their own abstract lessons.\n\nMMO gaming is becoming a more mainstream hobby, and as a lifelong gamer, I have plenty of experiences and stories to share on how the genre helped my transformation from a shy bundle of nerves to a confident professional. I also have experience applying my problem solving skills from software development into solutions for the community to combat problems that arose within the game.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
