  "description": "EuroPython 2022 - Game Development with CircuitPython - presented by Radomir Dopieralski\n\n[The Auditorium on 2022-07-15]\n\n\nMaking games on small devices is great fun and also a great way to learn. You don't have to worry about breaking anything, and the games tend to be much simpler than on the big computers. And with CircuitPython you don't need to install anything on your computer, all you need is a text editor. But it's not easy to decide what you need exactly: what hardware to get, which libraries to use and how to actually put it all together to spend the minimum time on all that, and maximum time on the game itself? I'm going to go over the available options, their pros and cons, and show some examples to get you started.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
