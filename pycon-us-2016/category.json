  "description": "PyCon is the largest annual gathering for the community using and developing the open-source Python programming language. PyCon is organized `by the Python community <https://us.pycon.org/2016/about/>`__ for the community. We try to keep registration far cheaper than most comparable technology conferences, to make PyCon accessible to the widest group possible. PyCon is a `diverse conference <https://us.pycon.org/2016/about/diversity/>`__ dedicated to providing an enjoyable experience to everyone. Our `code of conduct <https://us.pycon.org/2016/about/code-of-conduct/>`__ is intended to help everyone maintain the PyCon spirit. We thank all attendees and staff for observing it.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
