  "description": "Speaker: Josh Triplett\n\nMany Python modules, such as socket and select, wrap low-level functionality written in C and provided by the OS. But what if you don't have an OS, and don't want any C code? We implemented client and server networking in Python itself, for a bare-metal environment running without an OS.\n\nOur socket and select implementations support Python HTTP server and client modules, which we'll demo live.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
