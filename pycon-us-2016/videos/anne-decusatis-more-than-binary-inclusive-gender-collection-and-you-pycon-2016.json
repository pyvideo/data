  "description": "Speaker: Anne DeCusatis\n\nMany people identify their gender in many ways. So why do we build systems to capture accurate gender information with a dropdown that only lists \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d?\nThis talk covers why you might want to consider alternative ways of selecting gender for your users, a brief overview of the current best practices, issues addressed by my project Gender Amender, and why more work needs to be done.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
