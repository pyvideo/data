This talk focuses on how the Search and Ads teams at Yelp adopted IPython notebook and how it changed how analysis is undertaken and communicated. Tradeoffs between ease-of-use and reusable code production will also be discussed along with security implications of adoption in an enterprise context.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
