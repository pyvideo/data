  "description": "Speaker: Chloe Mawer\n\nAlmost anyone can set up their motion detection surveillance using just a few Python functions. This talk will walk through the development of a model used to detect whether a train is passing and in what direction it is going using a real-time video feed. You\u2019ll learn some basic motion detection techniques in Python as well as the effects of video quality on implementation.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
