  "description": "Speaker: Elizabeth Uselton\n\nBots are a fun, creative, community oriented project. They are perfect for a beginning programmer looking to build something cool, but open ended enough to hold the interest of an experienced developer. In this talk we'll go over the Python tools for building a great twitter bot, including where to find fun data sets, hosting your bot, delayed jobs, and examples of weird and wonderful bots.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
