  "description": "Speaker: Rebecca Bilbro\n\nVisualization has a critical role to play throughout the analytic process. Where static outputs and tabular data may render patterns opaque, human visual analysis can uncover volumes and lead to more robust programming and better data products. For Python programmers who dabble in machine learning, visual diagnostics are a must-have for effective feature analysis, model selection, and evaluation.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
