  "description": "Speaker: Dan Callahan\n\nCompared to native apps, mobile websites are at a disadvantage: no installing, no push notifications, and they only work when you're online. This year, that changes.\n\nBrowser vendors are working together to implement open standards that address each of these shortcomings. This session examines how the Service Worker, Push, and App Manifest specifications fill the gap between web and native.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
