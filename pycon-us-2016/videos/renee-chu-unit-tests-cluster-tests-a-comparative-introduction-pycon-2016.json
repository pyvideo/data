  "description": "Speaker: Renee Chu\n\nYou've worked on a shared code base and contributed software tests. Great job! But you don't yet know how to set up the holy grail: Having test coverage that's so complete, you can sleep easy knowing any mistake is caught and spoken for. This talk is a \"\"102\"\" level of test talks, describing the different layers of test protection (unit and cluster) and how to approach writing each.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
