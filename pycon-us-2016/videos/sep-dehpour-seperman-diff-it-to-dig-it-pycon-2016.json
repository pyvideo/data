  "description": "Speaker: Sep Dehpour (Seperman)\n\nDo you know about objects __dict__ and __slots__ and what they hold? Hashing unhashables? Objects with loops pointing to themselves? Objects that have changed and you want to know how? No? Then this is the talk for you. In this talk we will learn a lot by diffing Python data types and objects, the same way that you can learn a lot about code by git diff. May the diff habit be with you!\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
