One day our developers set out to create the modular, scalable infrastructure services they wanted in order to develop the cloud solution of their dreams. So SoftLayer started with an API that provides precision control and now is constantly working at finding ways to put more tools at developers\u2019 fingertips. Join us in this session as Angus Ip takes the audience though SoftLayer\u2019s journey and its developer profiles.\n\nBen Cheng, will join the session and talk about how Oursky is building its application on the cloud.
