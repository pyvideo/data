  "description": "Have you ever written a small, elegant application that couldn't keep up with the growth of your data or user demand? Did your beautiful design end up buried in threads and locks? Did Python's very special Global Interpreter Lock make all of this an exercise in futility?\n\nThis talk is for you! With the combined powers of AsyncIO and multiprocessing, we'll redesign an old multithreaded application limited by the GIL into a modern solution that scales with the demand using only the standard library. No prior AsyncIO or multiprocessing experience required.",
