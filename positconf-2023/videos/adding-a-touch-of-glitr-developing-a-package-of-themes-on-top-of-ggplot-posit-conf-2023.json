  "description": "Presented by Aaron Chafetz and Karishma Srikanth\r\nPlease note, a power issue cut off the first five minutes of the talk.\n\r\nExplore how our team at the US Agency for International Development (USAID) created our own data viz branding R package on top of ggplot2 and how you can too. \r\n\r\nHow do you create brand cohesion across your large team when it comes to data viz? Inspired by the BBC's bbplot, our team at the US Agency for International Development (USAID) developed a package on top of ggplot2 to create a common look and feel for our team's products. This effort improved not just the cohesiveness of our work, but also trustworthiness. By creating this package, we reduced the reliance on using defaults and the time spent on each project customizing numerous graphic elements. More importantly, this package provided an easier on-ramp for new teammates to adopt R. We share our journey within a federal agency developing a style guide and aim to guide and inspire other organizations who could benefit from developing their own branding package and guidance.\r\n\r\nMaterials: \r\n- https://speakerdeck.com/achafetz/adding-a-touch-of-glitr\r\n- https://usaid-oha-si.github.io/glitr/\r\n- https://issuu.com/achafetz/docs/oha_styleguide\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n\r\nTalk Track: Compelling design for apps and reports.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1103",
