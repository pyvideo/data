  "description": "Presented by Natalie O'Shea\r\n\r\nWorking in the high-touch world of consulting, our team needed to develop a reporting system that was flexible enough to be tailored to the specific needs of any given partner while still reducing the highly manual nature of populating client-ready slide decks with various metrics and data visualizations. Utilizing the extensive resources developed by the R user community, I was able to create a flexible, scalable reporting system that allows users to populate templated Google slide decks with metrics and professional-grade visualizations using data pulled directly from our database at the time of query. This streamlined approach enables our consultants to spend less time copy-pasting data from one channel to another and instead focus on what they do best: surfacing business-relevant insights and recommendations for our partners.\r\n\r\nBy sharing my approach to customizable self-serve reporting in Shiny, I hope attendees will walk away with new ideas about how to combine parameterized reporting and dashboard development to get the best of both worlds. Additionally, I hope to end by sharing how this project was pivotal in making the business case for procuring Posit products for my broader organization.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n\r\nTalk Track: Bridging the gap between data scientists and decision makers.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1075",
