  "description": "Presented by Michael Chow\r\n\r\nEvery data analysis in Python starts with a big fork in the road: which DataFrame library should I use?\r\n\r\nThe DataFrame Decision locks you into different methods, with subtly different behavior:: \r\n- different table methods (e.g. polars `.with_columns()` vs pandas `.assign()`) \r\n- different column methods (e.g. polars `.map_dict()` vs pandas `.map()`)\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll discuss how siuba (a dplyr port to python) combines with duckdb (a crazy powerful sql engine) to provide a unified, dplyr-like interface for analyzing a wide range of data sources\u201a whether pandas and polars DataFrames, parquet files in a cloud bucket, or pins on Posit Connect.\r\n\r\nFinally, I'll discuss recent experiments to more tightly integrate siuba and duckdb.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n\r\nTalk Track: Databases for data science with duckdb and dbt.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1101",
