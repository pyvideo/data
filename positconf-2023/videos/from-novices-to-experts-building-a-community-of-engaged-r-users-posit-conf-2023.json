  "description": "Presented by Natalia Andriychuk\r\n\r\nAt Pfizer, we have over 1500 users with R installed on their machines, along with an R community on MS Teams comprising over a thousand colleagues globally. How can we effectively engage with Pfizer R users and celebrate the successes of this community, while sharing best practices? Additionally, how do we avoid isolated groups duplicating efforts to solve R-related problems across different parts of the organization?\r\n\r\nTo address these challenges, we established the Pfizer R Center of Excellence (CoE) in early 2022. We focus our efforts on bringing together a rapidly growing community of colleagues, providing technical expertise, and offering best-practice guidance. A well-established, maintained and engaged R community promotes an inclusive and supportive learning environment that drives innovation within organizations. Our aim is to help colleagues thrive in their R journey, regardless of their expertise level.\r\n\r\nDuring my talk, I will share the techniques we used to build a supportive R community, the tools employed to increase community engagement, and the successes and challenges encountered in building an engaging community of R users.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n\r\nTalk Track: Pharma.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1066",
