  "description": "Presented by Erika Tyagi\r\n\r\nLearn how the Urban Institute is making high-quality data more accessible through the Education Data Portal. \r\n\r\nEvery year, government agencies release large amounts of data on schools and colleges, but this information is scattered across various websites and is often difficult to use. To make these data more accessible, the Urban Institute built the Education Data Portal, a freely available one-stop shop for harmonized data and metadata for nearly all major federal education datasets. In this talk, we'll demonstrate how the portal works and share lessons we've learned about making data accessible to users with varying technical skills and preferred programming languages.\r\n\r\nThe Urban Institute's Education Data Portal: https://educationdata.urban.org \r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n\r\nTalk Track: End-to-end data science with real-world impact.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1145",
