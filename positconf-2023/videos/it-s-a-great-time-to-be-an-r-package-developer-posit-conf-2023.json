  "description": "Presented by Jenny Bryan and Hadley Wickham\r\n\r\n(Due to unforeseen circumstances, Hadley Wickham presented this talk \"slide karaoke\" style, from materials prepared by Jenny Bryan.)\r\n\r\nIn R, the fundamental unit of shareable code is the package. As of March 2023, there were over 19,000 packages available on CRAN. Hadley Wickham and I recently updated the R Packages book for a second edition, which brought home just how much the package development landscape has changed in recent years (for the better!). \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I highlight recent-ish developments that I think have a great payoff for package maintainers. I'll talk about the impact of new services like GitHub Actions, new tools like pkgdown, and emerging shared practices, such as principles that are helpful when testing a package.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n\r\nTalk Track: Package development.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1132",
