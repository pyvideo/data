  "description": "Presented by Libby Heeren\r\n\r\nWhen we think about making connections, we think about networking. I'd like you to forget about networking and start thinking about making friends. I'll share my perspective as a community builder and host of the Data Humans podcast on how I cultivated a community of practice for myself and how I became a force multiplier who increases engagement. \r\n\r\nYou'll learn how I made genuine human connections, the practical steps to making data friends, the power of vulnerability, and why we all benefit when we show up as our whole selves.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n\r\nTalk Track: Lightning talks.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1167",
