  "description": "When we think about making connections, we think about networking. I'd like you to forget about networking and start thinking about making friends. I'll share my perspective as a community builder and host of the Data Humans podcast on how I cultivated a community of practice for myself and how I became a force multiplier who increases engagement. \r\n\r\nYou'll learn how I made genuine human connections, the practical steps to making data friends, the power of vulnerability, and why we all benefit when we show up as our whole selves.",
