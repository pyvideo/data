  "description": "Presented by Andrew Holz\r\n\r\nAs a team leader (accidental or not), it's easy to get caught up in the daily grind and overlook the importance of 1-on-1s. Bad idea. 1-on-1s are critical for building trust, providing feedback, and ensuring that everyone is on the same page.\r\n\r\nKeys to good 1-on-1s start with a small amount of prep and a running shared document of notes and takeaways. Another key is to rotate types of 1-on-1s. Possibilities include \"heads down\" on recent work, \"heads up\" looking further out, and career-focused sessions. After some tips on the right sort of questions and uncovering sneaky issues, I will also touch on effective feedback.\r\n\r\nI will share resources and hope to include Seussian visuals and a few poetic lines to help the key points stick.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n\r\nTalk Track: Building effective data science teams.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1064",
