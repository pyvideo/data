  "description": "Presented by Ellis Hughes\r\n\r\nSince its release, {gt} has won over the hearts of many due to its flexible and powerful table-generating abilities. However, in cases where office products were required by downstream users, {gt}'s potential remained untapped. That all changed in 2022 when Rich Iannone and I collaborated to add Word documents as an official output type. Now, data scientists can engage stakeholders directly, wherever they are. \r\n\r\nJoin me for an upcoming talk where I'll share my excitement about the new opportunities this update presents for the R community as well as future developments we can look forward to.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n\r\nTalk Track: Elevating your reports.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1156",
