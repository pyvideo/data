  "description": "Presented by Albert Rapp\r\n\r\nYou can get the most out of popular R tools by combining them with easy-to-learn HTML & CSS commands. \r\n\r\nIt's easy to think that R users do not need HTML and CSS. After all, R is a language designed for data analysis, right? But the reality is that these web standards are everywhere, even in R. In fact, many great tools like {ggtext}, {gt}, {shiny}, and Quarto unlock their full potential when you know a little bit of HTML & CSS. In this talk, I will demonstrate specific examples where R users can benefit from HTML and CSS and show you how to get started with these two languages.\r\n\r\nMaterials: \r\n- Here's the link to the video that I mention in the talk: https://youtu.be/QU8wSya-Y9E?si=zw59OSFPl1eJSY7M\r\n- Part 1 of this two part series can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jX4_Dnzhl0M\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n\r\nTalk Track: Compelling design for apps and reports.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1105",
