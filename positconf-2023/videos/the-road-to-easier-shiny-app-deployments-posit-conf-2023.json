  "description": "We're often helping developers to assess, fix and improve their Shiny apps, and often the first thing we do is see if we can deploy the app. If you can't deploy your Shiny app, it's a waste of time. If you can deploy it successfully, then at the very least it runs, so we've got something to work with. \r\n\r\nThere are a bunch of reasons why apps fail to deploy. They can be easy to fix, like Hardcoded secrets, fonts, or missing libraries. Or they can be intractable and super frustrating to deal with, like manifest mismatches, resource starvation, and missing libraries. \r\n\r\nAt the end of this talk, I want you to know how to identify, investigate and proactively prevent Shiny app deployment failures from happening.",
