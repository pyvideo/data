  "description": "Presented by Mike K Smith\r\n\r\nThe pharmaceutical industry is undergoing rapid change, driven by a desire from both industry and regulatory agencies to move to more interactive visualizations and web applications to review data and make decisions. These changes would have been unthinkable 30 years ago when I started working at Pfizer. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll consider the drivers for these changes, how open-source tools can help achieve this, and why collaboration across the industry is vital to achieving this goal. I'll contrast this with my experience of 30 years working in the pharma industry - when the R language had only just been released, when the internet was new, and when submissions to agencies were printed out, loaded onto trucks, and shipped to their doors.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n\r\nTalk Track: Pharma.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1067",
