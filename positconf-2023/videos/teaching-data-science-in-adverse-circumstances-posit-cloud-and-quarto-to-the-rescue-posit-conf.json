  "description": "Presented by Aleksander Dietrichson\r\n\r\nThe focus of this presentation is on the challenges faced by teachers of data science whose students are not quantitatively inclined and may face some adversity in terms of technology resources available to them and potential language barriers. I identify three main areas of challenges and show how at Universidad Nacional de San Mart\u00edn (Argentina) we addressed each of the areas through a combination of original curriculum redesign, production of course materials appropriate for the students in question; and the use of OS, and some Posit products, i.e.:posit.cloud and Quarto. I show how these technologies can be used as a pedagogical tool to overcome the challenges mentioned, even on a shoestring budget.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n\r\nTalk Track: Teaching data science.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1094",
