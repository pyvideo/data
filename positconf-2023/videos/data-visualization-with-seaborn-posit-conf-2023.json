  "description": "Seaborn is a Python library for statistical data visualization. After nearly a decade of development, seaborn recently introduced an entirely new API that is more explicitly based on a formal grammar of graphics. My talk will introduce this API and contrast it with the classic seaborn interface, sharing insights about the influence of the grammar of graphics on the ergonomics and maintainability of data visualization software.",
