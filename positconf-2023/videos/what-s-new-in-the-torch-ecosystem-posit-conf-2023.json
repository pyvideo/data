  "description": "Presented by Daniel Falbel\r\n\r\ntorch is an R port of PyTorch, a scientific computing library that enables fast and easy creation and training of deep learning models. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, you will learn about the latest features and developments in torch, such as luz, a higher-level interface that simplifies your model training code, and vetiver, a new integration that allows you to deploy your torch models with just a few lines of code. You will also see how torch works well with other R packages and tools to enhance your data science workflow. Whether you are new to torch or already an experienced user, this talk will show you how torch can help you tackle your data science challenges and inspire you to build your own models.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n\r\nTalk Track: Lightning talks.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1163",
