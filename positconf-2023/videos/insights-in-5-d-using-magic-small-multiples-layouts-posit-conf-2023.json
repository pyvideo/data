  "description": "Presented by Matt Dzugan\r\n\r\nUsing Small-Multiples (faceted graphs) is an effective way to compare patterns across many dimensions. In this talk, I'll walk you through some ways to lay out your individual facets according to the underlying data. For example, maybe each facet represents a city or point on a 2D plane - we'll explore ways to organize facets in a grid that mimics the data itself - unlocking your ability to explore patterns in 4+ dimensions. Other solutions to this problem rely on manually-curated lists that map common layouts to a grid, but in this talk, we'll explore solutions that work on EVERYTHING. I'll show you how to incorporate this technique into your viz and how I built the libraries since there are some interesting data science concepts at play.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n\r\nTalk Track: Lightning talks.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1174",
