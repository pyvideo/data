  "description": "Presented by George Stagg\r\n\r\nEarlier this year the initial version of webR was released and users have begun building new interactive experiences with R on the web. In this talk, I'll discuss webR's TypeScript library and what it is able to do. The library allows users to interact with the R environment directly from JavaScript, which enables manipulation tricks that seem like magic. I'll begin by describing how to move objects from R to JS and back again, and discuss the technology that makes this possible. I'll continue with more advanced manipulation, such as invoking R functions from JS and talk about why you might want to do so. Finally, I'll describe how messages are sent over webR's communication channel and explain how this enables webR to work with Shinylive.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n\r\nTalk Track: I can't believe it's not magic: new tools for data science.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1152",
