  "description": "A few years ago my company made a sudden shift from R to Python which was quite bad for my career because I didn't really know Python. The main issue was that I couldn't find a niche that allowed me to use my existing knowledge while learning the new language. \r\n\r\nShiny for Python is a great niche for R users because none of the Python web frameworks can do what Shiny can do. Additionally, almost all of your knowledge of the R package is applicable to the Python one. \r\n\r\nThis talk will provide an overview of the Python web application landscape and articulate what Shiny adds to this landscape, and then go through the five things that R users need to know before developing their first Shiny for Python application.",
