  "description": "Presented by Camila Saez Cabezas\r\n\r\nAre you considering or curious about developing code-based tools for scientists? Whether you are an experienced developer or a fellow Posit Academy graduate who might be stepping into this role for the first time, the aim of my story is to inspire you and help you navigate this process. While developing custom R functions, packages, and Shiny apps for diverse analytical capabilities and users in R&D, I learned why it's important to collect certain information at the start before writing any tidying, analysis, visualization, and web application code. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will share the essential technical questions that help me define and plan for success.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n\r\nTalk Track: Lightning talks.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1168",
