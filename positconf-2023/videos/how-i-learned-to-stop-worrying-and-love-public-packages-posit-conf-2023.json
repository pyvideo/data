  "description": "Presented by Joe Roberts\r\n\r\nThe popularity of R and Python for data science is in no small part attributable to the vast collection of extension packages available for everything from common tasks like data cleaning to highly-specialized domain-specific functions. However, with that ease of sharing packages comes a larger target for bad actors trying to exploit them. We'll explore these security risks along with approaches you can take to mitigate them using Posit Package Manager.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n\r\nTalk Track: Managing packages.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1079",
