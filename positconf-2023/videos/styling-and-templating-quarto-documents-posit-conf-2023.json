  "description": "Presented by Emil Hvitfeldt\r\n\r\nQuarto is a powerful engine to generate documents, slides, books, websites, and more. The default aesthetics looks good, but there are times when you want and need to change how they look. This is that talk.\r\n\r\nWhether you want your slides to stand out from the crowd, or you need your documents to fit within your corporate style guide, being able to style Quarto documents is a valuable skill. \r\n\r\nOnce you have persevered and created the perfect document, you don't want the effort to go to waste. This is where templating comes in. Quarto makes it super easy to turn a styled document into a template to be used over and over again.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n\r\nTalk Track: Compelling design for apps and reports.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1106",
