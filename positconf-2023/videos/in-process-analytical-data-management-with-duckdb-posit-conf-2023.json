  "description": "This talks introduces DuckDB, an in-process analytical data management system that is deeply integrated into the R ecosystem.\r\n\r\nDuckDB is an in-process analytical data management system. DuckDB supports complex SQL queries, has no external dependencies, and is deeply integrated into the R ecosystem. For example, DuckDB can run SQL queries directly on R data frames without any data transfer. DuckDB uses state-of-the-art query processing techniques like vectorised execution and automatic parallelism. DuckDB is out-of-core capable, meaning that it is possible to process datasets far bigger than main memory. DuckDB is free and open source software under the MIT license. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will describe the user values of DuckDB, and how it can be used to improve their day-to-day lives through automatic parallelisation, efficient operators, and out-of-core operations.\r\n\r\nMaterials:\r\n- https://duckdb.org\r\n- https://duckdb.org/docs/api/r.html\r\n- https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r",
