  "description": "A slow plots can ruin the user experience of our dashboard. This talk covers techniques for speeding up the rendering process of our visualisations.\r\n\r\nSlow dashboards lead to a poor user experience and cause users to lose interest, or even become frustrated. A common culprit of this situation is a slowly rendering plot. \r\n\r\nDuring the talk, we will dive deeper into how plots are rendered in Shiny, identify common bottlenecks that can occur during the rendering process, and learn various techniques for improving the speed of plots in R/Shiny dashboards. \r\n\r\nThese techniques will range from more efficient data processing to library-specific optimisations at the browser level.\r\n\r\nMaterials: \r\nI'd like to include a link to my linkedin profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryszard-szyma%C5%84ski-310a7017a/",
