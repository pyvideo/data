  "description": "The transition from analyzing data in R to making packages in R can feel like a big step. Writing code to clean data or make visualizations seems categorically different from building robust \"software\" on which other people rely. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll show why that distinction is not necessarily true by discussing my personal experience from learning R in graduate school to reporting bugs on GitHub to becoming a co-author of the tidycensus package and a practicing data scientist. The positive and supportive R community on GitHub, Twitter, and elsewhere contributes to why anyone who writes R code can become a package author.\r\n\r\n* I have not actually gotten rich but I did get freelance data work based on my package contributions!",
