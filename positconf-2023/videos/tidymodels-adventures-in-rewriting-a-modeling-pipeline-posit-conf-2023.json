  "description": "Presented by Ryan Timpe\r\n\r\nAn overview of the benefits unlocked on our data science team by adopting tidymodels.\r\n\r\nData science sure has changed over the past few years! Everyone's talking about production. RStudio is now Posit. Models are now tidy.\r\n\r\nThis talk is about embracing that change and updating existing models using the tidymodels framework. I recently completed this change, letting go of our in-production code and revisioning it with tidymodels. My team ended up with a faster, more scalable pipeline that enabled us to better automate our workflow and increase our scale while improving our stakeholders' experiences.\r\n\r\nI'll share tips and tricks for adopting the tidymodels framework in existing products, best practices for learning and upskilling teams, and advice for using tidymodel packages to build more accessible data science tools.\r\n\r\nMaterials: https://www.ryantimpe.com/files/tidymodels_adventures_positconf2023.pdf\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n\r\nTalk Track: Tidy up your models.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1082",
