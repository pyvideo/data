  "description": "Presented by Kirill M\u00fcller\r\n\r\nThe duckplyr R package combines the convenience of dplyr with the performance of DuckDB. Better than dbplyr: Data frame in, data frame out, fully compatible with dplyr.\r\n\r\nduckdb is the new high-performance analytical database system that works great with R, Python, and other host systems. dplyr is the grammar of data manipulation in the tidyverse, tightly integrated with R, but it works best for small or medium-sized data. The former has been designed with large or big data in mind, but currently, you need to formulate your queries in SQL.\r\n\r\nThe new duckplyr package offers the best of both worlds. It transforms a dplyr pipe into a query object that duckdb can execute, using an optimized query plan. It is better than dbplyr because the interface is \"data frames in, data frames out\", and no intermediate SQL code is generated.\r\n\r\nThe talk first presents our results, a bit of the mechanics, and an outlook for this ambitious project.\r\n\r\nMaterials: https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckplyr/\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n\r\nTalk Track: Databases for data science with duckdb and dbt.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1100",
