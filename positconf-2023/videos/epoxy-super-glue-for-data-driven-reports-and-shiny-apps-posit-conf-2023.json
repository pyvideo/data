  "description": "Presented by Garrick Aden-Buie\r\n\r\nR Markdown, Quarto, and Shiny are powerful frameworks that allow authors to create data-driven reports and apps. But truly excellent reports require a lot of work in the final steps to get numerical and stylistic formatting just right. \r\n\r\n{epoxy} is a new package that uses {glue} to give authors templating superpowers. Epoxy works in R Markdown and Quarto, in markdown, LaTeX, and HTML outputs. It also provides easy templating for Shiny apps for dynamic data-driven reporting. \r\n\r\nBeyond epoxy's features, this talk will also touch on tips and approaches for data-driven reporting that will be useful to a wide audience, from R Markdown experts to the Quarto and Shiny curious.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n\r\nTalk Track: Elevating your reports.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1155",
