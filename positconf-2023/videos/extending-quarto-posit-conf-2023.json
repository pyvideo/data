  "description": "Presented by Richard Iannone\r\n\r\nWhat are Quarto shortcode extensions? Think of them as powerful little programs you can run in your Quarto docs. I won't show you how to build a shortcode extension during this talk but rather I'm going to take you on a trip across this new ecosystem of shortcode extensions that people have already written. For example, I'll introduce you to the `fancy-text` extension for outputting nicely-formatted versions of fancy strings such as LaTeX and BibTeX; you'll learn all about the `fontawesome`, `lordicon`, `academicons`, `material-icons`, and `bsicons` shortcode extensions that let you add all sorts of icons. This is only a sampling of the shortcode extensions I will present, there will be many other inspiring examples as well.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n\r\nTalk Track: Quarto (2).\r\nSession Code: TALK-1141",
