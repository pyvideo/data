  "description": "Scaling the use of R can present complications for environment management, especially in regulated industries with a focus on traceability. One solution is controlled (aka \"frozen\") environments, which are carefully curated and tested by tech teams. However, the speed of R development means the environments quickly become outdated and users are unable to benefit from the latest advances. Enter {slushy}: a team-friendly tool powered by {renv} and Posit Package Manager. Users can quickly mimic a controlled environment, with the easy ability to time travel between snapshot dates. Attendees will learn how {slushy} bolstered our R adoption efforts, and how this strategy enables tech teams and users to work in parallel towards a common future.",
