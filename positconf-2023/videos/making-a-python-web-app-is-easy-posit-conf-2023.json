  "description": "Presented by Marcos Huerta\r\n\r\nMaking Python Web apps using Dash, Streamlit, and Shiny for Python\r\n\r\nThis talk describes how to make distribution-free prediction intervals for regression models via the tidymodels framework. \r\n\r\nBy creating and deploying an interactive web application you can better share your data, code, and ideas easily with a broad audience. I plan to talk about several Python web application frameworks, and how you can use them to turn a class, function, or data set visualization into an interactive web page to share with the world. I plan to discuss building simple web applications with Plotly Dash, Streamlit, and Shiny for Python.\r\n\r\nMaterials:\r\n- Comprehensive talk notes here: https://marcoshuerta.com/posts/positconf2023/\r\n- https://www.tidymodels.org/learn/models/conformal-regression/\r\n- https://probably.tidymodels.org/reference/index.html#regression-predictions\r\n\r\nCorrections:\r\nIn my live remarks, I said a Dash callback can have only one output: that is not correct, a Dash callback can update multiple outputs.\r\nI was trying to say that a Dash output can only be updated by one callback, but even that is no longer true as of Dash 2.9. https://dash.plotly.com/duplicate-callback-outputs\"\"\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n--------------------------\r\nTalk Track: The future is Shiny.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1086",
