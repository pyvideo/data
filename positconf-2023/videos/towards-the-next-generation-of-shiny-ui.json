The bslib R package helps solve this problem making very easy to apply modern and customizable styling your Shiny apps, R Markdown / Quarto documents, and more. In addition, bslib also provides dashboard-focused UI components like expandable cards, value boxes, sidebar layouts, and more to help you create delightful Shiny dashboards.\r\n\r\nMaterials: \r\n- https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/\r\n- https://bslib.shinyapps.io/flights/\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n\r\nTalk Track: Shiny user interfaces.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1124",
