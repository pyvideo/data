  "description": "Create awesome looking and feature rich Shiny dashboards using the bslib R package.\r\n\r\nShiny recently celebrated its 10th birthday, and since its birth, has grown tremendously in many areas; however, a hello world Shiny app still looks roughly like it did 10 years ago. The bslib R package helps solve this problem making very easy to apply modern and customizable styling your Shiny apps, R Markdown / Quarto documents, and more. In addition, bslib also provides dashboard-focused UI components like expandable cards, value boxes, sidebar layouts, and more to help you create delightful Shiny dashboards.\r\n\r\nMaterials: \r\n- https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/\r\n- https://bslib.shinyapps.io/flights/",
