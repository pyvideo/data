  "description": "Presented by Deepsha Menghani\r\n\r\nPlot animated and interactive visualizations with Plotly and Crosstalk in Quarto using R. In thi sintro to Plotly & Crosstalk in R: Using code examples, learn to integrate dashboard elements into Quarto with animated plots, interactive widgets (checkboxes), and linked plots via brushing.\r\n\r\nThis talk showcases how to use packages, such as Plotly and Crosstalk, to create interactive data visualizations and add dashboard-like elements to Quarto. Using a fun dataset available through the \u201cRichmondway\u201d package, we examine the number of times Roy Kent uses salty language throughout all seasons of \"\"Ted Lasso.\"\" We illustrate this using animated plots, interactive selection widgets such as checkboxes, and by linking two plots with brushing capabilities.\r\n\r\nMaterials:\r\n- Slides: https://deepshamenghani.github.io/posit_plotly_crosstalk/#/title-slide\r\n- Code repo: https://github.com/deepshamenghani/posit_plotly_crosstalk\r\n- Richmondway data package: https://github.com/deepshamenghani/richmondway \r\n- In-Depth Guide to Creating and Publishing an R Data Package (Richmondway) Using Devtools: https://medium.com/p/245b0fd4c359\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n\r\nTalk Track: Quarto (2).\r\nSession Code: TALK-1143",
