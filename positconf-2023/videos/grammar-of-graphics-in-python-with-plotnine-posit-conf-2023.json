  "description": "{plotnine} brings the elegance of {ggplot2} to the Python programming language. Learn about The Grammar of Graphics and get a feel of why it is an effective way to create Statistical Graphics.\r\n\r\nggplot2 is one of the most loved visualisation libraries. It implements a Grammar of Graphics system, which requires one to think about data in terms of columns of variables and how to transform them into geometric objects. It is elegant and powerful. This is a talk about plotnine, which brings the elegance of ggplot2 to the Python programming language. It is an invitation to learn about the Grammar of Graphics system and to appreciate it. It will include some tips on how to avoid common frustrations as you learn the system.\r\n\r\nMaterials: \r\n- Website: https://plotnine.org\r\n- Source Code: https://github.com/has2k1/plotnine\r\n- Slides for this talk: https://github.com/has2k1/my-talks",
