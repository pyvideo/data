  "description": "Presented by Tom Mock\r\n\r\nThis talk closes issue #10148, \"Github Copilot integration with RStudio\", the most upvoted feature request in RStudio's history. Code generating AI tools like Github Copilot\u201a promise an \"AI pair programmer that offers autocomplete-style suggestions as you code\". For the first time, we'll show a native integration of Copilot into RStudio, helping to build on that promise by providing AI-generated \"ghost text\" autocompletion with R and other languages. I'll also provide a comparison of Copilot's \"ghost text\" to a chat-style interface in RStudio via the {chattr} package from the Posit MLVerse team.\r\n\r\nTo make the most of these new features, I'll walk through some examples of how sharing additional context, comments, code, and other \"prompt engineering\" can help you go from code-generating AI tools that feels like an annoying backseat driver to an experienced copilot. We'll close with a robust end-to-end example of how these new RStudio integrations and packages can help you be a more productive developer.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n\r\nTalk Track: Data science infrastructure for your org.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1117",
