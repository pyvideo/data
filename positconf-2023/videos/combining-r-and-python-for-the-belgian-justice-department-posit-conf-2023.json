  "description": "Presented by Thomas Michem\r\n\r\nWe build a great case on how to combine R and Python in a production environment.\r\n\r\nSo the justice department's back office monitors the smooth processing of all traffic fines in Belgium. They gather that data from all police departments and check if any anomalies occur. \r\n\r\nThe back-office monitors that using a shiny application where they can see traffic signs showing the status of the whole operation and the status is built using Python scripts that perform anomaly detection if the number of fines is in line with what they expect daily. And the results of those checks are delivered to a front-end shiny application with Python flask API.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n\r\nTalk Track: R or Python? Why not both!.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1122",
