  "description": "Presented by Logan Pratico\r\n\r\nOne in five low-income renter households in the US experienced falling behind on rent or being threatened with eviction in 2021. Yet most are unrepresented when facing eviction in court. The complex and fast-paced legal system obscures access to timely information, leaving tenants without assistance.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I discuss the Civil Court Data Initiative's use of R alongside AWS Cloud and SQL to analyze disaggregate eviction records. I focus on the integration of RMarkdown with Amazon Athena and EC2 to create weekly eviction reports across 20 states for legal aid groups working to assist tenants. The upshot: accessible eviction data to help legal aid providers better address local legal needs.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n\r\nTalk Track: End-to-end data science with real-world impact.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1146",
