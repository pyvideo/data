  "description": "Presented by Susan McMillan, Wyl Schuth, and Michael Zenz\r\n\r\nAdoption of Quarto for document creation has transformed the collaborative workflow for our small higher-education analytics team. Historically, content experts wrote in Word documents and data analysts used R for statistics and graphics. Specialization in different software tools created challenges for producing collaborative analytic reports, but Quarto has solved this problem. We will describe how we use Quarto for writing and editing text, embedding statistical analysis and graphics, and producing reports with a standard style in multiple formats, including web pages.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n\r\nTalk Track: Elevating your reports.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1157",
