  "description": "Presented by James Balamuta\r\n\r\nFull talk title: Dynamic Interactions: Empowering Educators and Researchers with Interactive Quarto Documents Using webR\r\n\r\nTraditional Quarto documents often lack interactivity, limiting the ability of students and researchers to fully explore and engage with the presented topic. In this talk, we propose a novel approach that utilizes webR, a WebAssembly-powered version of R, to seamlessly embed R code directly within the browser without the need for a server. We demonstrate how this approach can transform static Quarto documents into dynamic examples by leveraging webR's capabilities through standard Quarto code cells, enabling real-time execution of R code and dynamic display of results. Our approach empowers educators and researchers alike to harness the power of interactivity and reproducibility for enhanced learning and research experiences.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n--------------------------\r\nTalk Track: Quarto (1).\r\nSession Code: TALK-1073",
