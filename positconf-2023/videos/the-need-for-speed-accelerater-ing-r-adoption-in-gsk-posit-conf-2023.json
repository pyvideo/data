  "description": "Presented by Ben Arancibia\r\n\r\nHow does a risk-averse Pharma Biostatistics organization with 900+ people switch from using proprietary software to using R and other open-source tools for delivering clinical trial submissions? First slowly, then all at once. GSK started the transition of using R for its clinical trial data analysis in 2020 and now uses R for our regulatory-reviewed outputs. The AccelerateR Team, an agile pod of R experts and data scientists, rotates through GSK Biostatistics study teams sitting side by side to answer questions and mentor during this transition. \r\n \r\nWe will share our experience from AccelerateR and how other organizations can use our learnings to scale R from pilots to full enterprise adoption and contribute to open source industry R packages.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n--------------------------\r\nTalk Track: Pharma.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1068",
