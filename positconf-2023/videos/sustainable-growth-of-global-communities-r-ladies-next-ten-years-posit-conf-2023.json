  "description": "Presented by Riva Quiroga\r\n\r\nIn this talk we share how good programming practices inspire the way we manage the R-Ladies community in order to make it sustainable.\r\n\r\nR-Ladies' first ten years were about growing the community: from being just one chapter in 2012 to becoming a global organization in 2016, and now fostering more than 230 chapters worldwide. But how can we face the challenges of growing an organization based solely on volunteer work?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we discuss how good programming practices \u2013such as modularity, refactoring, and testing\u2013 inspire the way we see the sustainable management of an ever-growing community. To that end, we will present our most recent efforts at creating and documenting workflows, distributing the workload, and automating tasks that allow volunteers to focus their time where it is most needed. \r\n\r\nAfter watching this talk, you will get some ideas on how to support volunteers in your own community or project, and on how to use GitHub Actions to automate workflows and tasks. \r\n\r\nLearn more and join at: https://rladies.org/\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n--------------------------\r\nTalk Track: It takes a village: building and sustaining communities.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1128",
