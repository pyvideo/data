  "description": "Conformal inference theory enables any model to produce probabilistic predictions, such as prediction intervals. We'll demonstrate how these analytical methods can be used with tidymodels. Simulations will show that the results have good coverage (i.e., a 90% interval should include the real point 90% of the time).",
