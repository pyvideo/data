  "description": "Presented by Nick Strayer\r\n\r\nSince its alpha debut at last year's conference, the ShinyUiEditor has experienced continuous development, evolving into a powerful tool for crafting Shiny app UIs. Some key enhancements include the integration of new bslib components and the editor's ability to create or navigate to existing server bindings for inputs and outputs.\r\n\r\nIn addition to new features, the editor is now available as a VSCode extension enabling it to integrate smoothly into more developers' workflows. This talk will showcase how these new capabilities empower users to efficiently create visually appealing and production-ready applications with ease.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n\r\nTalk Track: Shiny user interfaces.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1126",
