The {pointblank} package, along with Posit Connect, modernizes how we tackle data validation within Data Services. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will briefly summarize how we develop test code with {pointblank}, share with {pins}, execute with {rmarkdown}, and report findings with {blastula}. Finally, I will show how we aggregate data from test results across projects into a holistic view using {shiny}.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n--------------------------\r\nTalk Track: Leave it to the robots: automating your work.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1058",
