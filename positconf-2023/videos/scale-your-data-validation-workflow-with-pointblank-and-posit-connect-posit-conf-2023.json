  "description": "For the Data Services team at Medable, our number one priority is to ensure the data we collect and deliver to our clients is of the highest quality. The {pointblank} package, along with Posit Connect, modernizes how we tackle data validation within Data Services. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will briefly summarize how we develop test code with {pointblank}, share with {pins}, execute with {rmarkdown}, and report findings with {blastula}. Finally, I will show how we aggregate data from test results across projects into a holistic view using {shiny}.",
