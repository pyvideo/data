  "description": "Presented by Trang Le\r\n\r\nOnboarding new hires can be a challenging process, but taking a problem-focused approach can make it more meaningful and rewarding. In this talk, I will share how I discovered the ultimate new hire hack by creating two small packages that gave me the confidence I needed when I started at BMS. Through building these packages, I not only learned R things like using bslib and making font files available for published dashboards, but also gained a deep understanding of my company's internal systems and workflows, and connected with my team via lots of questions. The resulting packages are still heavily used today. \r\n\r\nJoin me to discover how small packages can have a broad impact and what hiring managers can do to help.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n--------------------------\r\nTalk Track: Developing your skillset; building your career.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1112",
