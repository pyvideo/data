  "description": "Presented by Lydia Gibson\r\n\r\nThrough my participation in R4DS Online Learning Community, I have advanced my R and data science skills, making me a better student than I otherwise would have been through just my studies. As a non-traditional MS Statistics student with an undergraduate background in economics, I had absolutely no experience with the R programming language prior to pursuing my Master's degree. In July 2021, with hopes of getting a headstart on learning R before beginning my degree program, I joined the R4DS Slack Workspace. Along with helping to improve my programming skills, R4DS has connected me with scholarships, mentorship, and other opportunities, and I think that it would be beneficial for other students to know about this great resource.\r\n\r\nPresented at Posit Conference, between Sept 19-20 2023,\r\nLearn more at posit.co/conference.\r\n\r\nTalk Track: Developing your skillset; building your career.\r\nSession Code: TALK-1110",
