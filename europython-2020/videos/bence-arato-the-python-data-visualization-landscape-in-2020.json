  "description": "\"The Python Data Visualization Landscape in 2020\nEuroPython 2020 - Talk - 2020-07-24 - Parrot Data Science\nOnline\n\nBy Bence Arat\u00f3\n\nPython offers many different data visualization libraries, and the sheer number of alternatives  can be daunting to newcomers.\n\nThis talk aims to introduce the most important visualization libraries, covering Matplotlib, Plotly, Bokeh and Altair, among others. It also provides a summary of the quickly developing dashboarding solutions, including Dash, Panel and Voila.\n\nThe goal of talk is not just to provide a simple list of libraries, but also to highlight the main characteristics and inspirations for each, and summarize the recent developments as well.\n\nThis talk is aimed to people who have some basic experience working with data in Python and would like to get a better understanding of the data visualization tool landscape.  Some existing knowledge of pandas DataFrames is beneficial for understanding the examples, but not required.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2020.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/\n\n    \"",
