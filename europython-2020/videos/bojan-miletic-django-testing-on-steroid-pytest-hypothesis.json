  "description": "\"Django Testing on Steroid: pytest + Hypothesis\nEuroPython 2020 - Talk - 2020-07-23 - Brian\nOnline\n\nBy Bojan Miletic\n\nThe talk should hopefully provided value to all listeners, regardless of their knowledge level, but preferably you have some knowledge of pytest test parametrization\n\nWe'll use a simple Django project, setup initial tests using pytest with some parallelization in the opening part and afterwards start extending them with Hypothesis. We'll go over the details, how you can use them to detect edge cases, extend test coverage and if time allows it how you can use them to test django models.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2020.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/\n\n\"",
