  "description": "\"pyRT - Computer Graphics in Jupyter Notebooks for Fun and Teaching\nEuroPython 2020 - Talk - 2020-07-23 - Microsoft\nOnline\n\nBy Martin Christen\n\nPyRT (pronounced pirate) is a raytracer/image generator for Python 3.5 and higher. This project is mainly done with the following in mind:\n\n\nray tracing in the Jupyter notebook\nTeaching computer graphics and ray tracing\nExploring ray tracing concepts for geo data using Python.\nRendering geo data, including large point clouds.\nImplementing new algorithms for rendering large 3D city models.\nCreating 3D-Maps from OpenStreetMap data\nServer-side rendering / cloud based rendering\n\n\nIn this talk I will present the project and show some examples. I will show how useful it is to create quick 2D animations, such as visualization of different sorting algorithms and I how to create fractals and other graphics. A certain focus is also on geodata therefore I will show how to create a live EarthQuake map using pyRT.\nIn the last part I will show to use pyRT to create 3D renderings.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2020.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/\n\n\"",
