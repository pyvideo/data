  "description": "\"Developing a match-making algorithm between customers and Go-Jek products!\nEuroPython 2020 - Poster session - 2020-07-24 - Poster 1\nOnline\n\nBy Gunjan Dewan\n\nGoJek has millions of monthly active users in Indonesia across our 20+ products and services. A major problem we faced was targeting these customers with promos and vouchers that were relevant to them. We developed a generalized model that takes into account the transaction history of users and gives a ranked list of our services that they are most likely to use next. From here on, we are able to determine the vouchers that we can target these customers with.\nIn this poster, I will be presenting our process while developing the model, the challenges we faced during the time, how we used PySpark to tackle these challenges and the impact it had on our conversion rates.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2020.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/\n\n\"",
