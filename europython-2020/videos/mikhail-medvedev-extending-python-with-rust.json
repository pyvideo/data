  "description": "\"Extending Python with Rust\nEuroPython 2020 - Talk - 2020-07-23 - Microsoft\nOnline\n\nBy Mikhail Medvedev\n\nRust is a rising star of the programming language world. I'd like to discuss it from a Python developer perspective. Obviously, Rust is not a replacement for Python, but in case you're seeking better performance it may be a good idea to build an extension. This is safer and arguably easier to do in Rust than in C.\nIn this talk we will take a look at existing crates that provide interface to Python and see how easy it is to use them.\nThen we go through the demo and see it in action.\nRun some benchmarks against pure Python and also Cython.\nWrite a Dockerfile to build it all together.\nDiscuss CI/CD for mixed Rust/Python projects.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2020.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/\n\n\"",
