  "description": "\"Live-coding a music synthesizer\nEuroPython 2020 - Talk - 2020-07-24 - Ni\nOnline\n\nBy Ram Rachum\n\nThis is going to be a fun live-coding session using NumPy and SoundDevice. The goal of this talk is to make the computer produce realistic-sounding instrument sounds, using nothing but math.\n\nAll the code will be written live and we'll hear the audio that it produces.\n\nWe\u2019ll start with creating a simple sound using a sine wave. We\u2019ll gradually make it sound more like a real instrument, learning a little\nbit about music theory on the way. We\u2019ll add features one-by-one until by the end of the talk, we\u2019ll hear our synthesizer play a piece\nof classical music.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2020.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/\n\n    \"",
