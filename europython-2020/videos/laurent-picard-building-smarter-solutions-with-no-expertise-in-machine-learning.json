  "description": "\"Building smarter solutions with no expertise in machine learning\nEuroPython 2020 - Talk - 2020-07-23 - Parrot Data Science\nOnline\n\nBy Laurent PICARD\n\nML? API? AutoML? Python is the language of choice to solve problems with machine learning, but what can we build in only a few hours or days and without any expertise? In this session, we'll see how to benefit from existing ML models and how to create a custom model with AutoML techniques. We\u2019ll also be active players of a live demo, so don't put your smartphone on airplane mode!\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2020.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/\n\n    \"",
