  "description": "\"Pluggable Architecture\nEuroPython 2020 - Talk - 2020-07-23 - Ni\nOnline\n\nBy Aly Sivji\n\nApplications and libraries with a pluggable architecture allow developers to add custom functionality. Plugins can customize user interfaces, create new workflows, and interface with legacy systems. Designing a plugin is often difficult - documentation is sparse, outdated, or non-existent. You end up diving into a unfamiliar codebase to figure out what to do.\n\nThis talk examines Pluggable Architecture by creating a custom plugin system: we will design an interface, think about where to hook in custom behavior, and discuss testing techniques. Understanding these principles will enable us to write custom plugins for third-party libraries. Extend the functionality of your favourite library without touching existing code!\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2020.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/\n\n\"",
