  "description": "\"Simulation of logistic systems in Python with salabim\nEuroPython 2020 - Poster session - 2020-07-24 - Poster 2\nOnline\n\nBy Ruud van der Ham\n\nDiscrete event simulation is a very powerful technique in many fields, like transport, warehousing, hospitals, manufacturing and logistics.\nThere are several commercial packages that provide high end GUIs to design a system and to animate the operations. These  packages are neary always close source and are very expensive (think USD 10-20 K per user). Often implementing complex algorithms is cumbersome.\nOn the other end of the spectrum are open source packages that use existing program languages. Python is particularly interesting because of the vast number of (scientific) packages, like machine learning, statistics and databases.\nIn te Python landscape there is SimPy, that is rather limited in functionality. In this poster I will present my discrete even simulation package called salabim. Salabim uses coroutines via generators and makes it very easy to model complex systems. The package offers advanced real time (2D) animation, monitoring and statistical sampling.\nI will show some applications and how a simple model is built up.\n\nRuud van der Ham, core developer salabim\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2020.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/\n\n\"",
