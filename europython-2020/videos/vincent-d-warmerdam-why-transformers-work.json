  "description": "\"Why Transformers Work\nEuroPython 2020 - Talk - 2020-07-24 - Microsoft\nOnline\n\nBy Vincent D. Warmerdam\n\nThis will be a technical talk where I'll explain the inner workings of the machine learning algorithms inside of Rasa. In particular I'll talk about why the transformer has become a part in many of our algorithms and has replaced RNNs. These include use-cases in natural language processing but also in dialogue handling. \n\nYou'll see a live demo of a typical error that an LSTM would make but a transformer wouldn't. The algorithms are explained with calm diagrams and very little maths.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2020.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/\n\n    \"",
