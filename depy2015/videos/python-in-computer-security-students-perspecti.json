We hope to show how we\nhave utilized python to within our area of study and why it is important\nfor future students. Our goal is to encourage future classes of students\nto enjoy scripting. We will introduce how we as security students\nutilize Python as an everyday tool with specific examples of how we used\nPython in various security competitions and gave us a noticeable\nadvantage over other teams. This will include scripts used as defenders\nagainst various red team attacks\n",
