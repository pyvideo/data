  "description": "Machine learning is a fascinating field with numerous applications in\ndata science. New research is always emerging in the field of machine\nlearning but it can take years for this research to be converted into\nusable software libraries. In this talk, I'll be providing a technique\nfor reading (actually reading) research papers and using the powerful\nsyntax and data-focused libraries of Python to write up quick and dirty\nimplementations of techniques written out in research papers. This talk\nis relevant to any practical professional who occasionally strays into\nthe field of academics to discover new techniques that are applicable to\nthe data problems that they are attempting to solve.\n",
