  "description": "Python is a powerful, easy-to-use language which now has a wide range of\nnumerical and machine-learning open source libraries. At Civis\nAnalytics, we've built a cloud-based platform for data science which\nempowers analysts to extract insights from their data with less effort.\nThe platform itself runs on Amazon Web Services, and the machine\nlearning workflows at the core of the platform are coded in Python.\nOpen-source Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, statsmodels, and\nscikit-learn let our data scientists focus on high-level workflows and\ngreatly accelerate our development process. In this talk, I'll give an\noverview of Civis's new data science platform, focusing on the\nmachine-learning aspects. I'll talk about how we use Python open-source\nlibraries to help with data analysis, and some of the challenges we've\novercome along the way.\n",
