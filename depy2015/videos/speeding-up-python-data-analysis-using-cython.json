  "description": "Python is an ideal language for developing software for the analysis of\nscientific data. Although packages such as NumPy, SciPy, and pandas can\noffer execution speeds similar to those possible using statically typed,\ncompiled languages, oftentimes Python code is too slow for the task at\nhand. Cython is a static compiler for Python which, with the addition of\na few type declarations, allows Python code to execute at significantly\nfaster speeds. This talk will detail how to use Cython to optimize the\nrun time of Python code for analysis of scientific data with examples\ntaken from the development of algorithms in the Python ARM Radar Toolkit\n(Py-ART), an open source library for working with weather radar data in\nPython.\n",
