  "description": "As a penniless academic I wanted to do \"big data\" for science. Open\nsource, Python, and simple patterns were the way forward. Staying on top\nof todays growing datasets is an arm race. Data analytics machinery\n\u2014clusters, NOSQL, visualization, Hadoop, machine learning, ...\u2014 can\nspread a team's resources thin. Focusing on simple patterns, lightweight\ntechnologies, and a good understanding of the applications gets us most\nof the way for a fraction of the cost. These patterns appear underline\nthe design of Mayavi, for interactive 3D visualization, scikit-learn, for\neasy machine learning, and joblib for out-of-core and parallel computing.\n\nI will present a personal perspective on ten years of scientific data\nprocessing with Python. What are the emerging patterns in data\nprocessing? How can modern data-mining ideas be used without a big\nengineering team? What constraints and design trade-offs govern software\nprojects like scikit-learn, Mayavi, or joblib? How can we make the most\nout of distributed hardware with simple framework-less code?\n",
