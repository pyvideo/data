  "description": "Monitoring and debugging your live application\n\nPresented by Robert Coup\n\nAbstract\n\nEver wondered what is going on inside your app? Learn some tools and\nideas you can use for sussing it out.\n\nOutline\n\nDebugging issues in live applications can be a real nightmare. Add some\nmore logging, restart it, wait for the failure/load case and try and\ndeduce a bit more. Even with awesome test coverage you still need to\ndebug those tricky problems. This talk will introduce some ideas for\nmonitoring and debugging your live applications. The key things to cover\nare:\n\n-  the standard logging module and learning how to drive it well. How to\n   log effectively so it makes sense later, and what sorts of things we\n   should be instrumenting and measuring.\n-  how to set up a remote console session into our running application,\n   so we can interrogate variables and run code to figure out what's\n   going on.\n-  how to incorporate IRC or IM bots so we can interact with our apps\n   from the desktop, and how they can interact with us.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor. Slides are hard to read.]\n",
