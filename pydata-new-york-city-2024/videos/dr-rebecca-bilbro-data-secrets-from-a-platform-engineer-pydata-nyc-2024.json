Present in every pipeline, every query, every notebook, it shapes the availability, consistency, and resilience of the systems on which we depend. In this talk, discover how understanding more about \u201cthe Platform\u201d can enable data scientists to make choices that improve their chances of getting to production. The path to unlocking your data superpowers awaits. Will you take it?\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
