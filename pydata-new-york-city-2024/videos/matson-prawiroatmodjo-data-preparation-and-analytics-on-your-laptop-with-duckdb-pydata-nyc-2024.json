  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nWhat if I told you that you could complete a JSON parse and extract task on your laptop before a distributed compute cluster even finishes booting up? DuckDB is a lightweight, in-process analytical database that runs on your laptop inside of Python and can wrangle large datasets efficiently, both from local and remote data sources. In this talk, we will show you how to query a dataset with DuckDB to extract, load and transform data right on your laptop. We'll then show you how to move your workloads to the Cloud, so you can run them at scale. By developing locally and pushing to the Cloud it's not only easy to develop, debug and iterate, but also makes it easy to quickly switch back and forth between workloads that do and don't require Cloud compute resources, cutting both cost and time.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
