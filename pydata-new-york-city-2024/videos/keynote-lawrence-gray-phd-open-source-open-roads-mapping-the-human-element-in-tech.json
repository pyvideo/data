The stories will highlight the transformative power of open-source communities, the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity, and the importance of openness and human connection in defining your careers. The keynote will begin with Dr. Gray's personal story, a testament to the unexpected ways in which Python can serve as a lifeline. Dr. Gray will then transition to his experiences in open-source communities, drawing parallels between the challenges of building sustainable projects and the unexpected adventures of his road trips.\n\nAn AI leader with a mission, Dr. Lawrence Gray brings a wealth of experience from the consulting, accounting, and geospatial intelligence sectors to his role as Director of Engineering at KUNGFU.AI. With a Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins in Cellular and Molecular Physiology and a career spanning over 10 years, Dr. Gray has consistently pushed the boundaries of what's possible with machine learning and data-driven decision-making. As an Adjunct Professor at Georgetown University, he shapes the next generation of data practitioners, teaching courses in Data Analytics and Data-Driven Decision Making. Dr. Gray's commitment to open science is evident in his work with NumFocus and as a core maintainer of Yellowbrick. Currently authoring two books for Manning Publications, he continues to share his expertise with the wider tech community. Dr. Gray is particularly excited by the potential of AI to drive new discoveries in mental health, fueled by a passion to improve the lives of those affected by mental illness. This enthusiasm reflects his belief in AI as a powerful tool for groundbreaking research and positive societal impact.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
