  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nThe goal of this tutorial is to give you hands-on experience accessing & using NASA Earthdata Cloud (https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/) \u2014 i.e., freely available satellite data \u2014 through Pythonic APIs. Ideally, you are a data-curious Pythonista who wants to use NASA data products for geospatial analysis. Modest experience with the PyData stack is expected, but you'll be walked through particular corners of the relevant libraries (e.g., Xarray (https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/index.html), Rasterio (https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), Hvplot (https://hvplot.holoviz.org/), etc.) as required. You'll need only a web browser & a network connection to connect to a pre-configured cloud computing environment. The case studies you'll explore \u2014 floods & wildfires \u2014 highlight strategies for \"data-proximate computing,\" i.e., using cloud-compute resources with distributed data. At the end, you'll be set up to carry out your own explorations of NASA's publicly available earth data in Python.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
