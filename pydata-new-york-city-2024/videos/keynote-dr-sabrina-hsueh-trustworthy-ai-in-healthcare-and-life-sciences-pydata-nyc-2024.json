As technological innovations, including generative AI, evolve rapidly and regulatory pathways remain unclear, the industry is at the forefront of adopting trustworthy AI and setting the standards to drive innovation, optimize operational efficiencies, and enhance health outcomes.\n\nDr. Sabrina Hsueh is an accomplished Ethical AI and External Innovation Lead at Pfizer, where she spearheads the development and implementation of AI strategies. With a focus on AI observability, guardrails, and governance, Dr. Hsueh champions equitable AI in healthcare across enterprises such as IBM and Pfizer, as well as start-ups in the A16z and Khosla Ventures portfolios. Dr. Hsueh leads industrial AI standard-setting initiatives with public-private partnerships and professional societies. She also serves on the ACM Practitioners\u2019 Board, co-chairs the Women in AMIA steering committee and co-founded an international work group to address global women\u2019s health gaps and drive diversity and inclusion in informatics. Her dedication to leveraging informatics and AI evaluation has led to over 80 technical publications, patents, and co-edited special issues in reputable journals and textbooks (e.g., Personal Health Informatics by Springer Nature). Dr. Hsueh's commitment to ethical AI and her leadership in AI standardization make her a sought-after speaker and consultant, winning awards and nominations across the fields as a Responsible AI leader in HCLS, paving the way for a more trustworthy adoption of AI technologies in a dynamic regulatory landscape.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
