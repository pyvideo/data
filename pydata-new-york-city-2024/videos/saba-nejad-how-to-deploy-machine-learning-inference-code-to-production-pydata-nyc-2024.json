  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nLet\u2019s say you want to run a machine learning experiment \u2013 you want to tag a paragraph with appropriate labels. Given all the models and sample code out there, writing a notebook or python script that does this is often relatively easy, though running it end to end on your single computer can, at times, take a while and make everything else slow \u2013 these processes are compute heavy.\n\nNow, let\u2019s say you like what your notebook is doing, you have made the best tagging script out there, and you want to enable all your users to be able to tag their paragraphs using your magic. Imagine if you wanted to deploy this to many users, how would you do that? What are steps you can take to not have all your users waiting for minutes before they get their tagged output?\nRunning machine learning inference on your local machine vs deployed to hundreds of users can look very different. In this talk, I will walk through a case study and share learnings from having to optimize a tagging project for latency and memory.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
