However RAGs are often prone to hallucinate by using irrelevant information to construct their answer. Context filter guardrails eliminate this failure mode!\n\nTypical guardrails only allow decisions based on the output, and have no impact on the intermediate steps of an LLM application. While it is commonly discussed to use guardrails for blocking unsafe or inappropriate output from reaching the end user, guardrails can also be leveraged to improve the internal processing of LLM apps.\n\nGuardrails can use a variety of different implementations to judge relevance, including LLM-as-judge and smaller classification models.\n\nGuardrails leverage feedback functions to evaluate the context relevance of each context chunk, and block irrelevant context from reaching the LLM for generation. Doing so eliminates hallucination from irrelevant context and reduces token usage by the generation step.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
