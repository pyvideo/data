  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nscikit-learn is a machine-learning library for Python that uses NumPy and SciPy for numerical operations. Scikit-learn has its own compiled code for performance-critical computation written in C, C++, and Cython. The library primarily focuses on Cython for compiled code because it is easy to use and approachable. In this talk, we dive into many techniques scikit-learn employs to utilize Cython fully. We will cover features like using the C++ standard library within Cython, fused types, code generation with the Tempita engine, and OpenMP for parallelization.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
