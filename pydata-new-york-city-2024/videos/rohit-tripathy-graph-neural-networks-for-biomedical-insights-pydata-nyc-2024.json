  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), the predominant form of dementia worldwide, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by severe cognitive decline. Despite the widespread prevalence of AD, and significant investment into AD research, our understanding of this disease is still evolving owing to the complex interplay of the genetic and molecular mechanisms involved. Effective therapeutic development for AD requires a deeper understanding of these underlying interactions. In this talk, we first demonstrate how graph neural networks are utilized to integrate multi-modal molecular data (i.e. multi-omics data) to build predictive models of AD. We then apply machine learning interpretability methods to our models to generate insights into the disease\u2019s underlying drivers and reveal key biological interactions. We discuss the technical challenges encountered, the limitations of our current approach, and potential future directions for advancing research in this field.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
