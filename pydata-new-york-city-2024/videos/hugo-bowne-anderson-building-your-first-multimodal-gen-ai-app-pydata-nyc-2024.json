You\u2019ll gain insights into the latest AI technologies and build an interactive app that you can speak to, generating text, audio, music, images, and video. We\u2019ll guide you through integrating models from platforms like Replicate and Hugging Face, as well as leading language models such as Bard, Claude, Mistral, and ChatGPT. By the end of the workshop, you\u2019ll have practical experience creating a versatile AI application and a deeper understanding of how these technologies can be harnessed.\n\nRequirements:\n- GitHub account\n- GitHub Codespaces enabled\n- API keys for Groq or OpenAI, and Replicate (we will guide you through obtaining these during the tutorial)\n- Basic Python and Bash knowledge\n\nMaterials will be distributed through a GitHub repository, including setup instructions and example code.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
