We'll cover everything from simple pandas assertions and SQL joins to more advanced tools like duckdb and datacompy. Additionally, we'll dive into time series data frame diffing using asof joins. Finally, we'll discuss how to perform these operations at scale on platforms like Apache Spark, Snowflake and BigQuery. We will also discuss insights from commercial tools like Datafold\u2019s Data-Diff and how these ideas can be implemented in both open-source and enterprise environments.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
