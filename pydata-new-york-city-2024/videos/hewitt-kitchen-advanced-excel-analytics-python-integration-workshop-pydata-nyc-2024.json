Attendees will actively engage in hands-on exercises, culminating in the creation of a functional model that integrates advanced Python capabilities within Excel. The session is designed for data scientists, engineers, and senior leaders looking to understand and implement these tools in their data ecosystems. Participants will explore custom reprs, configurable return types, and real-world applications, gaining practical skills applicable to various industries.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
