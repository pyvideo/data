Unfortunately, in most organizations, identifying the root cause of a breakage can take engineers hours of manually sifting through logs and dashboards. In this talk, we\u2019ll describe a fast, automated, and holistic approach to root cause analysis via an ensemble of structural causal models. This talk should be relevant to anyone interested in causal modeling, the field of observability, reliability engineering, or anyone wanting to troubleshoot production software issues faster.\n\nSlides for this talk can be found here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1j5hoaayuPku2HDejuQaXnrq7sZA10IUZFp8jWPFLRoM/edit?usp=sharing\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
