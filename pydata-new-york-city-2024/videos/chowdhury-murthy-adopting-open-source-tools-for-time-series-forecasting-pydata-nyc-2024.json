The open-source community has developed several Python libraries to streamline the commonly recurring stages of a forecasting pipeline, thereby minimizing redundancy and ensuring consistency across different projects. Python Libraries like SKTime, SKForecast, and Darts are some of the most used libraries for time series forecasting; data science teams are often confounded with crafting systematic approaches to evaluating such options.\nIn this talk, we will present a decision framework for data science leaders and teams to choose the appropriate tooling for their forecasting projects. Specifically, we will explore three critical dimensions that teams must consider:\n\nData Understanding: How well does the library support Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?\n\nData Preparation: How robust and intuitive are the tool's preprocessing capabilities for handling quality issues, like missing values, NaNs, duplicate data, and exogenous variables?\n\nModeling & Backtesting: How effective and scalable are the library\u2019s modeling and evaluation capabilities for forecasting algorithms?\n\nEach of these dimensions present tradeoffs and our decision framework is intended to help evaluate and mitigate them. We will present a case study from energy management and use SKTime and SKForecast to guide the discussion. The work presented in this talk was conducted as part of my internship at Schneider Electric.\n\nThis talk is ideal for data scientists, machine learning engineers, and technical decision-makers that develop and maintain forecasting products and are driven to scale their efforts. Whether you are new to time series forecasting or an experienced practitioner looking to refine your toolset, this session will provide valuable insights into selecting the right open-source tools for your project.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
