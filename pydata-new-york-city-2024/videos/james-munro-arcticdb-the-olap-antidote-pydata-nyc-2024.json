  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nModern OLAP databases are amazing for doing quite simple calculations at scale, but is that what we need? I'll argue that online analytics processing isn't that useful for data science, and that the raw read and write throughput of these databases doesn't impress. OLAP is a business model, where 'Online' means 'someone else's environment', and as a result it gets marketing and mindshare. We need to be discerning about our choice of tools. I'll look at why and how we've optimised our workflow for throughput instead, along with working with data collaboratively where data-science (and in our experience Quant) is the focus, and what that means in terms of improved flexibility and productivity for users.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
