This workshop offers a comprehensive introduction to building RAG applications, exploring the architecture and good design principles, while diving into hands-on examples with popular open-source AI & data engineering tools such as LangChain, ChromaDB, and embedding models.\n\nMake sure you clone the GitHub repo and complete the instructions at the README before joining: https://github.com/theam/rag-workshop-pydata-nyc-2024\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
