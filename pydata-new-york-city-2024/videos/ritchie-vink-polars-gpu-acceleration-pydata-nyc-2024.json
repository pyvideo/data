This year the project has landed its 1.0 milestone and this September it has landed GPU acceleration in collaboration by NVIDIA Rapids. The combination of the Polars query optimizer and the NVIDIA acceleration, makes it very suitable for even higher performance workloads.\n\nIn this talk we explain the integration of GPU acceleration in Python Polars with cuDF. We'll explore the tightly-coupled approach where cuDF hooks in after the Polars IR (Intermediate Representation), allowing for seamless GPU execution on top of Polars' existing optimizations. Learn about the design constraints, implementation challenges and performance on different query types. Finally, we\u2019ll explore what\u2019s more to expect from the Polars team.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
