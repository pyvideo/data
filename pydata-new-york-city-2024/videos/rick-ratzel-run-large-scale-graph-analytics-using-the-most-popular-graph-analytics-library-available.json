With monthly downloads in the tens of millions, a large and friendly community, a wealth of documentation and examples, and a wide breadth of algorithms behind an easy-to-use API, NetworkX has earned its household name status among data scientists. Despite these advantages, NetworkX has struggled to keep up with the demands of many modern workloads resulting from our world's growing appetite for large data, which forces users to rewrite their code for a harder-to-use but more performant library.\n\nHowever, NetworkX recently added support for third party backends to accelerate its popular API, and NVIDIA has responded with nx-cugraph, a NetworkX backend that uses cuGraph for extremely fast and scalable graph analytics. This talk will provide the background and details covering the features that allow NetworkX to leverage third-party backends such as nx-cugraph, and demonstrate how users can run their NetworkX code on CPU-only systems, then without code modifications, migrate to a GPU-enabled environment to realize huge performance increases.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
