Data for pretraining is usually scraped from internet which is full of duplicates and having undesired contents like hate, abuse and profanity.\n\nTo produce a quality model, the collected data needs to go through the series of transformations to improve its quality, add attributes ( e.g. detect language ), make it safe ( e.g. remove spam ) and put it in a common format expected by training module.\n\nData Prep Kit (https://github.com/IBM/data-prep-kit ) aka DPK is a open source project ( created by IBM ) to transform the input data collected from internet (https://commoncrawl.org/ ) into data ready for training.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
