Large Language Models (LLMs) have become powerful tools for this task, revolutionizing how we process and comprehend data. However, the journey from raw data to insightful summaries isn't without its hurdles. Beyond their impressive capabilities, LLMs face significant challenges, particularly when dealing with extensive texts. How can we overcome the constraints of limited context windows? How to even scale such LLMs for thousands of concurrent users? In this talk Aarti will walk through the art and science of tackling these issues, from effectively chunking long documents, optimizing model performance within limited context windows and eventually deploying such models into production. She will also demonstrate advanced evaluation techniques to ensure that the summaries generated are both accurate and meaningful. An AI enthusiast or a seasoned professional, this session will equip the attendees with strategies to enhance their text summarization and maximize the potential of LLMs.\n\nPresentation - https://github.com/aartij22/Pydata-NYC-2024\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
