  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\n\"Python is so slow\", \"it doesn't scale\", \"it will hog memory\". We've all heard it before. And while sometimes this is true, there are known ways around this and Rust is the newest language on the block making inroads into the Python world for that purpose. In this talk, we're going to explore PyO3 (Sometimes referred to as PyOxide)\u2014a super cool project that lets you bring the speed and safety of Rust into Python with minimal hassle. If you've ever hit a performance wall or if you\u2019ve just been curious about Rust and what it can do, this session is for you. I will share our perspective from building Bytewax with Python and Rust as well as walk through how you can start \"Oxidizing\" your Python code, making it faster and more efficient, all while keeping the flexibility you love about Python.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
