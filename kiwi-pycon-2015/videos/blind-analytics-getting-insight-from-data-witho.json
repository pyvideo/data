  "description": "This talk will start with an overview of current methods of privacy\npreserving computation including homomorphic encryption, secret sharing,\nand differential privacy.\n\nWe will explore current uses of privacy preserving computation, in\nfields such as government, finance, telecommunications and IoT. We will\nlook at the technological and social barriers to wider adoption then\ngaze into the crystal ball to see where the future might take us.\n\nTo conclude we will explore one technique (partially homomorphic\nencryption) with a motivating medical example. A high level overview of\nthe open source library ``python-paillier`` will be given along with a\nfew code samples showing how easy (some) privacy preserving analytics\ncan be to implement.\n",
