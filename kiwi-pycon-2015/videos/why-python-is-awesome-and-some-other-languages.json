  "description": "Switching between many languages quickly clarifies each language's\nstrengths and weaknesses. My background is in Java \u2013 however more\nrecently I have moved onto using Python, JavaScript and PHP, whilst\ndabbling in Go. My talk will cover:\n\n-  Asynchronous programming, and the various ways it can be written in\n   code, with reference to JavaScript and Go.\n-  Packaging, how some languages do it better and worse than Python, and\n   what Python can learn from them.\n-  Unit testing in all languages is hard, but the syntactic sugar that\n   is added can ease the pain, and make the output when your tests\n   inevitably fail easier to read.\n-  Syntax Shock, what brackets and semi-colons? Why are you not running\n   \u2013 oh yes I need a semi-colon there.\n-  Cool stuff with Magic(al) methods and Duck Typing that languages like\n   Java would not have a hope of implementing.\n\nThis talk will highlight some of the delight I get when coming back to\nPython; and some of the aspects of other languages that I think would be\nreally cool to add.\n",
