  "description": "This talk introduces the approach of operating a monorepo for various libraries and services in a Python project. \nIn the process, the team adopted Rye as their package manager, and the presentation will also cover the features of Rye.\n\nSimply approaching a monorepo might unnecessarily increase complexity, so the speaker will share methods the team considered and implemented to prevent this while maximizing the benefits. The speaker will also introduce their personal experience in building and operating monorepos.\n\nThis talk is recommended for those who need to build shared libraries using Python or operate multiple services in an MSA environment.",
