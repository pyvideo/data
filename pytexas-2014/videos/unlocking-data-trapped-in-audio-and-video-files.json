  "description": "As more and more apps record audio and video files we need to start\nthinking about what to do with those files. Playing them back isn't\nenough. Media files are full of data that developers can start\nexploiting thanks to an emergent category of signal and natural language\nprocessing APIs.\n\nThere are only 3 options for processing the words embedded in these\nfiles:\n\n1. Transcribe them yourself, manually.\n2. Find a transcript made by someone else.\n3. Use a library that extracts the words for you.\n\nAs the developer of a python library that automates the extraction and\nprocessing of words in media files, I'll demonstrate how easy it is to\nmake audio and video libraries fully searchable, create a word cloud of\nkeywords from a recorded phone call, and extract topics from news\nbroadcast.\n\nI'll show coding examples as well as products using this API.\n",
