  "description": "Since the beginning of 2000s, Eric von Hippel has presented Models on\nhow Paradigm Shift from Producer Innovation to User and Open\nCollaborative Innovation, this can be true not only on products, also in\nhow the users can produce innovation on service like the OpenData & Open\nGovernment, don't need the main publisher, researcher or Government\nprovide all the work. The communities can push more innovation around\nthis new services.\n\nNowadays, everybody can improve the data available, curate, create,\npublish and provide more value on public & open data. Learn a framework\nlike Flask is more accessible than ever, host & publish REST services\nfor free, host the code of project for free also. It's democratizing all\nthe way. All can be done with Python.\n\nIn this presentation I'll demonstrate how can use GitHub to publish a\ndata sets (and proper updates) and the code of the Python REST API with\nno more than 100 lines of code which can be deployed on local\ninstallation, plus, with few commands, deploy on a service with a free\ntier like OpenShift for a worldwide audience.\n",
