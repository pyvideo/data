It pairs well with Python\n101 following a similar outline but at a deeper level. Rather than starting\nwith \"Hello, world!\", we use the interactive Python interpreter to get hands-\non familiarity with much of core Python before covering blocks and scripts.\nThe tutorial is divided into short sections, each with presentation and\nexercises, to quickly cover lots of ground. Advanced topics are introduced\nthroughout and covered in \"extra credit\" exercises such that more advanced\nparticipants can learn at their own pace.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2009/196_pycon-2009-python-102-part-2-of-3.mp4", "tags": ["pycon", "pycon2009", "python-basics"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-Python102Part002967-183.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
