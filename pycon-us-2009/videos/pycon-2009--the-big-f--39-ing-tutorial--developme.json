  "description": "The Big F'ing Tutorial: Development Using repoze.bfg Web Framework (Part\n1 of 3)\n\nPresented by Chris McDonough\n\nAre you a Python web developer who thinks there might be some great\nstuff hidden away in Zope but you consider it inaccessible to you\nbecause you feel that Zope imposes too many foreign concepts for your\ntastes? Are you a more- or-less happy Zope developer that has the\nnagging feeling that much of Zope is unnecessary \"baggage\" on your\ncurrent project? Maybe you're a Plone developer who feels that Plone is\nunsuitable for one of your current projects because it's too\ncomplicated? This tutorial will present everything you need to know\nabout repoze.bfg, a small Python web framework in the spirit of Pylons.\nThe goals of repoze.bfg are simplicity, familiarity to Zope programmers\n(but no Zope experience is required), execution speed, and complete,\ncomprehensive, and up-to-date documentation. In this tutorial, we'll\nexplain the core concepts in repoze.bfg, then we'll lead a guided\ndevelopment session where we make a small application using the\nframework. We'll also cover packaging and deployment of the application.\nQuestions are highly encouraged during the presentation.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: ]\n",
