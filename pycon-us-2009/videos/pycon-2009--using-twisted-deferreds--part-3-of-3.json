  "description": "While the documentation about deferreds is good, it is still not enough\nfor many. In this interactive tutorial, I will cover both the basics of\ndeferreds and many non-trivial use-cases, with discussion of various\napproaches. Common mistakes, gotchas and other issues will be explained,\nas well as good idioms and techniques to use deferreds without pain.\nDeferreds bring asynchronous APIs the clarity and programming power that\nis sometimes lost when using event-based programming. They are an idea\ntaken from many other programming languages, and made into a Pythonic\nsolution If you are using Twisted, or would like to use Twisted, this\ntutorial can help you with one of the most subtle issues inherent in its\nAPIs - Deferreds.\n",
