  "description": "How to build great admin user interfaces while still leveraging the\npower of the Django's batteries-included admin.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Django admin interface is a great tool for rapidly viewing and\ngenerating content, but its default one size fits all approach may not\nbe the best for the users of it.\n\nThis talk is broken into two parts. First, we will discuss user\nexperience and what users have come to expect from an admin tool. In the\nsecond half, we'll show you how to bend Django's admin to meet those\nexpectations.\n",
