  "description": "PyDX 2016 talk by Hobson Lane\n\nIntermediate python developers will learn how to build a chatbot engine that identifies bullying in chatrooms. Studies show that most free-for-all social networks (Twitter, Facebook, Twitch, Slack) unintentionally make us less kind and supportive. But there's Hope. At Hopester we've built an open source chatbot engine with an open API called Hope. We'll show you how to add Hope to your chat channels or build your own.",
