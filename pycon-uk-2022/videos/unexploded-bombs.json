    "description": "Find the flaws in your codebase ... before they explode\n\nThe SS Richard Montgomery is a ship with a strange history. Sunk in the mouth of the Thames Estuary during WWII, she's filled with an unknown number of explosives. There have been various attempts over the years to figure out the danger from this ship and potentially clear her - but so far, nothing has been done.\n\nEvery codebase has its own unexploded bombs. potentially serious problems lurking beneath the surface of our code. How can we identify and tackle them? Software is just as vital to our safety as other kinds of engineering - I'll delve into some famous cases such as the Therac-25 incidents to show what can go wrong when we don't appreciate this.\n\nLet's use the Richard Montgomery as a metaphor to explore ways to make our code safer and more robust. Together, we can develop into software professionals and clear up problems in advance. *Before* we set anything on fire.",
