Lessons learnt from the human side of Python.\n\nWhen JPMorgan decided to give Python development tools to hundreds of non-developers, it was a no-brainer.\n\nGiven the huge amounts of financial data available and the tools becoming easier to use, it made sense to allow the business to extract relevant information directly themselves.  \n\nBut how?\n\nClearly the infrastructure had to be there: a Python development & runtime environment, access to data and to JPMorgan analytics.\n\nBut having the infrastructure ready was only the beginning.  We needed training.  It needed to be relevant, rewarding, and even fun.  \n\nAnd what about the culture?  How do we get non-developers to take their first plunge into Python, and then get into good development habits, without becoming full-time developers?\n\nThis is the story of our on-going journey.  We learnt some important lessons along the way.  We\u2019ll share them so that you too can give Python to non-developers.",
