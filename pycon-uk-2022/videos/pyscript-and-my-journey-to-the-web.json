    "description": "While PyScript is not yet ready for production use, it has provided an opportunity for a back-end Python developer like me to learn more about front-end web development. This talk chronicles how I used PyScript in my journey to better understand how to build web applications in Python!\n\nThis talk chronicles how I used Python to journey from web \u2018noob\u2019 to something greater.  \n\nWhile I\u2019ve been using Python to develop back-end services for several years, I had not previously developed any web applications. PyScript presented an excellent opportunity for me to leverage my existing Python knowledge to help fill this gap in my skills.\n\nPyScript is a framework that enables developers to create Python applications in the browser using HTML's interface and the power of Pyodide, WebAssembly (WASM), and other modern web technologies. It was announced by Peter Wang during his recent keynote at PyCon US 2022. While it is classed as \u201cvery alpha\u201d and not yet suitable for production, it has proven to be a useful tool for exploration and learning.",
