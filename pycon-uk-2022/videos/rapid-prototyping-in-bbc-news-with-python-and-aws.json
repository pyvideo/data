We have worked with the BBC's flagship radio news programme production team to enrich programme timelines with metadata to provide enhanced experiences to the audience. We are currently working with local radio teams around the UK to provide the means to capture highlights in live radio for re-use and for social media, reducing the workload for producers, and getting more mileage from linear broadcast programmes.\n\nWorking in short cycles, it's important for us to be able to quickly build processing pipelines connected to BBC services, test and iterate on ideas and demonstrate working prototypes. We make use of modern cloud technologies to accelerate delivery and reduce friction.\n\nIn this talk I will share our ways of working, our ideation and research methods, and the tools we use to be able to build, deploy and iterate quickly, the BBC's cloud deployment platform, and our use of serverless AWS services such as Lambda, Step Functions and Serverless Postgres.",
