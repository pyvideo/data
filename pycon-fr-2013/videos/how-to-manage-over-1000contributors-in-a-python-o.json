  "summary": "Very large development: How to manage over 1000 contributors in a Python\nopen source project\n\nIn this talk I want to present how the OpenStack project (one of the\nlargest Open Source projects in Python) deals with QA, Peer Review and\ngeneral quality control of the patch submissions. I will cover the\ntools, guidelines and best practice put in place to manage the\ncomplexity.\n\nOpenStack is a very large project with over 1.6 million lines of code,\nover 1000 active contributors and approximately 4000 commits per month.\nAt least according to the latest stats from Ohloh.net. And this project\nis written (almost) completely in Python. This makes OpenStack one of\nthe largest active open source projects written in this language.\n\nIn this presentation I will to talk about the challenges of large scale\ncollaboration in Python projects and the solutions set up by the\nOpenStack community to address them. By studying the typical life cycle\nof a patch, I will present the tools involved in testing, peer review,\ncontinuous integration, as well as the tools enforcing community\npolicies like style checking or maintaining compatibility across\ndifferent Python versions.\n",
