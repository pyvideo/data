  "abstract": "My team developed software that was used as part of a medical product.\nWe used modern development practices and tools to document the code and\nthe APIs exposed by our microservices, but was that enough?\n\nThis talk introduces the audience to the particularities of developing\nmedical device software and the regulatory landscape that you must\ncomply with. I\u2019ll focus specifically on the processes and culture that\nenables the creation of medical software device documentation intended\nfor auditors, without damaging (too much) the team velocity and spirit.\n",
