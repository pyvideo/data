  "abstract": "I started my career in technology, working in Customer Support for a\nsmall start up in little old New Zealand. To help our Support team scale\nas the business quickly grew, we needed to invest in a fool-proof\nself-service strategy.\n\nWe work in an industry with customers that don't identify themselves as\n\"tech savvy\", so to help them get up and running with our product\nquickly we needed friendly, accessible and engaging product education.\n\nVideo was one of the first things we identified as being a crucial part\nof our product education strategy. In this talk, I'll share my\nexperience with using, producing and managing videos, as part of\ndocumenting an ever-changing and evolving product. We\u2019ll chat about:\n\n-  Why you should be making videos\n-  When to use videos\n-  When you shouldn't be making videos\n-  How to develop a video strategy\n-  How to make great product tutorials\n\nIf you're looking to start your adventure in video, this talk will give\nyou insight into how to develop and deliver a video strategy, with some\nhelpful insights and lessons learned along the way.\n",
