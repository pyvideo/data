  "description": "Accessibility (a11y) has been finding its stride in the web development\ncommunity \u2010 and it\u2019s not hard to figure out why. According to the World\nHealth Organization, there are over one billion people globally who need\nan assistive device. With these statistics, organizations and open\nsource projects alike realize that they could be unintentionally locking\nthese people out of their products. As a result, they adjust their\ndeveloper workflows. And it often ends there, at the product.\nDocumentation is left out of the conversation.\n\nIf documentation is meant to serve as a tool for learning and\ncomprehension, then it must be included in those conversations. After\nall, we want to write docs that are truly for everyone \u2010 regardless of\nthe technology they use to read it.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll look at how assistive technology consumes\ndocumentation and cover some points to consider when building out your\ndocs. Along the way, we\u2019ll touch on quick regulation wins and inclusive\nwriting practices.\n",
