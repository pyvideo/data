Worse, lots of us believe our products are simple. But trust me,\nthey\u2019re not simple! Your installation guide failed on step 2, and I\ndon\u2019t know how to fix it! In this talk I highlight some writing styles\nwhich seem innocuous when written, but which show a lack of sympathy\nwhen read. I suggest some ways to avoid these pitfalls and bridge the\ngap with your reader.\n",
