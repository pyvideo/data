  "description": "We all know what it\u2019s like to look at a series of existing documentation\nand think, \u201chow did this happen?\u201d Be it a large swath of unorganized\ncontent or a lack of a clear strategy, the complications of bad docs\naren\u2019t just a curse for documentation editors. Our readers see it, too.\nIt leads to confused support requests and possibly a loss of customers.\n\nWhen I started at Joyent, I was continuously made aware of documentation\nthat needed help, and it felt like a nonstop firefight. Over time, I was\nable to quell the fires, create a content strategy, and completely\nredefine how our documentation works. Then all of my work was blown up a\nsecond time \u2010 this time, starting from scratch with a not yet existing\nproduct. From this experience, I\u2019ve learned it\u2019s all about being\norganized and having a clear strategy.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll discuss:\n\n-  how to get buy\u2010in for a documentation do\u2010over\n-  how to pivot from rewriting docs to starting from scratch\n-  content strategy (and how to write a great one)\n-  empathy for our readers\n-  setting easy\u2010to\u2010follow guidelines for non\u2010professional writers\n\nWe\u2019ll also touch on how to prioritize and manage all of this work\nwithout additional full\u2010time documentation help.\n",
