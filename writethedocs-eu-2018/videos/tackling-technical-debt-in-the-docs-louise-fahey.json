  "description": "In a world of legacy content, how do we resolve the issue of technical\ndebt in our documentation?\n\nAs technical communicators, it\u2019s very easy to get caught up in the cycle\nof moving from one release to another without taking time to refine what\nalready exists. Trying to keep up with documenting new features means we\noften find ourselves navigating though outdated and disused\nstylesheets/labels/files/content/junk in projects that we inherited from\ntechnical communicators before us and haven\u2019t had the time to clean up.\n\nIf this sounds familiar, then this presentation is for you!\n\nIt aims to help you tackle the daunting task of cleaning up your project\nand getting rid of technical debt once and for all. We will cover:\n\n-  What is technical debt, how does it accrue, and why should your\n   organisation care\n-  How you can tackle your debt and give your documentation project the\n   spring clean it needs\n-  Tips for staying debt\u2010free\n",
