  "abstract": "How do you prove that docs are key to growing a software business?\n\nDocumentarians have long struggled to get buy-in from stakeholders and\nwin more budget because the impact of docs on a company\u2019s bottom line\nhas never been clear.\n\nThings like traffic analysis, at best, tell you whether customers are\nfacing a recurring problem, or if they\u2019re finding your docs easily.\nArticle ratings also help you understand if customers find your docs\nuseful. But to prove that docs actually impact your bottom line, you\nneed to dig deeper.\n\nIn this talk, I\u2019ll share new models I\u2019ve designed to help measure if\nyour docs drive customer growth:\n\n-  What would your company look like without docs? (A basic control for\n   measuring success)\n-  Do your docs help win new users? (Acquisition-focused attribution)\n-  Are users who read your docs more likely to take the key steps to\n   become customers? (Activation-focused attribution)\n-  Can docs help convert new customers into loyal advocates?\n   (Retention-focused attribution)\n\nI\u2019ll demonstrate how you can apply these models to your business, with\nboth theoretical and practical advice.\n",
