  "abstract": "As a Lean Trainer and Manager in service industries, I work with all\nkinds of teams to help them use process mapping to document their\nprocesses. Sifting through binders of documentation, pages of\nscreenshots, and step\u2010by\u2010step explanations can be time consuming and\nawkward, and large quantities of documentation are time consuming to\nkeep up to date. System updates would quickly render screenshots\nobsolete, and teams were quickly getting overwhelmed, giving up on\ndocumentation entirely. I started to apply my lean expertise to the art\nof process mapping, putting together a best practice toolkit to maintain\na minimalist approach to documenting processes.\n\nWe'll discuss best practice in process mapping for:\n\n-  visual instruction in user guides and how\u2010to\u2019s\n-  mapping process at high levels, avoiding getting bogged down in\n   detail\n-  assessing possible failure points to anticipate customer pain points\n   (to manage through customer documentation)\n",
