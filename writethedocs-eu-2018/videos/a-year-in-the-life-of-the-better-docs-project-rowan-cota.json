  "description": "A year ago (or so) BuzzFeed realized we had a documentation problem. Our\ndocs were kept in numerous places, from Google Drive to Wikis to Github\nfolders to...places we may not even have found yet! In response we\nstarted a working group called The Better Docs Project, with the mission\nof organizing, standardizing, and completing our documentation.\n\nDuring this talk we\u2019ll go on a narrative journey through the first year\nof Better Docs, talking about what worked for us, what didn\u2019t work, what\nwe\u2019re excited to try next, and the lessons we\u2019ve learned (and friends\nwe\u2019ve made) along the way. I\u2019ll share actionable tips for how to steal\nour experience to get your own projects and workplaces on the road to\nBetter Docs.\n",
