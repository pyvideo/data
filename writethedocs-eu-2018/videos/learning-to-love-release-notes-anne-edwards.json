  "abstract": "I\u2019ll be talking about an area of technical writing that\u2019s not\nparticularly glamorous, and tends not to get much love: the humble\nrelease note.\n\nWhen I joined my current company back in September 2017, I noticed we\ndidn\u2019t have a consistent format for our release notes, and they were\noften clunky and difficult to understand. And when I did a bit of\nresearch to see if there were any generally accepted formats, I was\nsurprised at how little guidance I found.\n\nI realised I had plenty of my own ideas about what made a good release\nnote (from reading and writing many over the years), so I gathered them\ntogether and gradually formed them into a style guide. Drawing from\nthis, I\u2019ll talk about:\n\n-  making release notes easier to write \u2010 and read \u2010 by grouping them\n   into categories and then using templates to write them\n-  how you can improve readability with a few simple style tweaks\n-  viewing release notes as a ready\u2010made opportunity to show your users\n   the hard work you\u2019ve put into your product \u2010 the bugs you\u2019ve fixed,\n   and the suggestions you\u2019ve listened to\n",
