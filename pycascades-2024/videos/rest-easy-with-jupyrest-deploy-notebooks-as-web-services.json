  "description": "Jupyter notebooks are awesome! However, a notebook on its own is not a product or a service. Bridging this gap usually involves a complete rewrite into a web service that leaves behind all the awesome-ness of the notebook. What if we didn't have to do this? That's where Jupyrest comes in! Jupyrest is a library I created to solve this exact problem for my team at Microsoft. In this talk I'll show you how you can turn your Jupyter notebooks into a web service without any modifications to it. Jupyrest is being used at Microsoft by data scientists to deploy hundreds of microservices.",
