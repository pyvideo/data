  "description": "Python is an excellent language, in part because of how accessible it is. This accessibility means that professionals in finance, science, marketing, etc, often can make use of it for their goals. This also means that for programmers who write tools for these users, Rust can make an excellent language to deliver a fast, stable experience. In this talk we'll discuss more about why you might consider augmenting your Python code with Rust and walk through a case study for how to achieve it.",
