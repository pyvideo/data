  "description": "Come learn how to program CircuitPython wirelessly over Bluetooth and WiFi. CircuitPython is a version of Python designed for small computers used in electronics projects called microcontrollers. Bluetooth is great for connecting devices to a phone or tablet on the go. At home, WiFi simplifies connecting to a multitude of devices without needing to plug into them directly. Both are also great for devices that are hard to access.",
