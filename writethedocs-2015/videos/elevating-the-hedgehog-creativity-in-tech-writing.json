In this talk, I assert that tech writers are a natural fit to help their organizations transition from the Information Age to the Conceptual Age. I&#39;ll also give and seek ideas on how we as writers can apply Pink&#39;s six aptitudes -- storytelling, empathy, design, humor, games, and finding meaning -- to make our work more fulfilling, if not more competitive.\nThe key underlying message for those who attend this talk is: YOU are a designer. Even if you haven&#39;t traditionally seen yourself in this role, writers are information designers who serve a unique, user-focused and holistic function on development teams. By recognizing that fact, and opening up space in your work life for creativity, you can have an even bigger impact and a more fulfilling career.",
