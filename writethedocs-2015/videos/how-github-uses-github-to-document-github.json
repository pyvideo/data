What you may not know is that the same workflow developers use to create, update, and manage their software is also used to create, update, and manage GitHub&#39;s documentation.\nhttps://help.github.com is GitHub&#39;s second-most viewed site--after the main website itself. I&#39;d like to provide a somewhat opinionated look on how our valiant Documentation team writes and releases content for features on GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise. I&#39;ll go over:\nHow our teams (Development, Security, Docs, etc) coordinate before launching a feature\nThe importance of opening pull requests early\nThe review/edit cycle with peers\nHow we incorporate DITA best practices into our Markdown documentation\nValidating content through CI and automated tests\nHow we incorporate feedback from our users",
