Many factors helped, but a major element was the support we added for new contributors.\n\u201cScratch your own itch\u201d is the proverbial invitation to contribute to open source projects. How well this works for contributing to code is open to debate, but it rarely makes sense for open source documentation, especially for well-established projects. Not only is it unhelpful for the project, which typically has plans (or at least wishlists) for improving the docs, but it provides very little guidance to the contributor as to what they might do, what they personally are able to do, and what would be most helpful to do.\nIn the 10 years that MDN has been a wiki (some of the content pre-dates the wiki), the community has always welcomed constructive contributions by anyone who bothers to create a user account. Over the years, we\u2019ve created meta-documentation about contributing to the site, including wishlists of things we\u2019d like to see documented. However, these didn\u2019t necessarily help newcomers gain traction.\nOnly in the last year or so have we created documentation to help new contributors specifically. Our aim is to help newcomers find the right match among:\nTopics and tasks the person is interested in (what they like)\nTasks the person has the skills and time to do (what they can do)\nTasks that help MDN meet the goals that Mozilla has set (what we need/want)\nI\u2019ll describe the features we\u2019ve put in place to achieve this, as well as things we\u2019re still working on. I\u2019ll leave space for discussion so we can all share ideas and successes.",
