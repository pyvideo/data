  "description": "Heidi Waterhouse\nhttp://lanyrd.com/2015/writethedocs/sdmpdt/\nWe talk a lot about minimum viable products, and building our products up from small features. We talk a lot about failure, and how to learn from it and not replicate failures over and over again. But what I haven\u2019t heard a lot of discussion about is how we know we\u2019ve succeeded. Is it market share? Usable product? Could understanding and setting a measurable, achievable goals help us overcome imposter syndrome, second sock syndrome, and feature creep?\nThis talk provides some metrics on identifying success, documenting what it will look like when you get there, preserving the idea, and dealing with the inevitable distractions and changes in direction that may prevent you from ending up where you expect.\nI plan to speak on how documentation can serve a crucial function at both defining and driving success. We need to stop believing that agile is the end of the answer and embrace it as part of building what we want to have in the end.\nContinuous improvement can have a victory condition, if we build it.",
