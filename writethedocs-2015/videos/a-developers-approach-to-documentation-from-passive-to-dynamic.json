  "description": "Gregory Koberger\nhttp://lanyrd.com/2015/writethedocs/sdmwxz/\nThe era of O\u2019Reilly books is done, finito, kaput. With so much of the developer experience online, we know a great deal about each individual user and about the code we document. Why, then, do we documentarians persist in providing the same walls of text to each of our readers, especially when there are so many more personalized ways of describing technical tools and code?\nThis talk addresses the move from passive to dynamic documentation. As code goes mainstream, more and more consumers of APIs and technical writing will be non-technical. Technical writing bears a responsibility to reduce the learning curve as much as possible for these readers, and it can do that by being much more intimate about its relationship with them.",
