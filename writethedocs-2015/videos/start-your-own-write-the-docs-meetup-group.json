  "description": "Mike Jang\nhttp://lanyrd.com/2015/writethedocs/sdmwwy/\nWith just a little work, you can feel the joy of Write The Docs all year!\r\nI started the Write The Docs PDX Meetup Group back in May of 2014, just after last year\u2019s conference. As the only writer in my office, I often feel alone. At Write The Docs NA 2014 conference, I felt the joy of interacting with documentarians like myself, people who were facing similar challenges. I wanted to continue feeling that joy.\r\nI\u2019ll describe my experiences creating a Write The Docs Meetup group in Portland. I\u2019ll show you how easy* it is to create a Meetup group, attract members, get sponsors, find speakers, and make sure all members of your group feel welcome. I\u2019ll tell you about the Meetups we\u2019ve had, and what we learned from each other.\r\nMore importantly, I\u2019ll lay out the ways you can continue the conversation we&#39;ve had during WTD 2015. I&#39;ll share my best practices for excellent Meetups for Documentarians.\r\n*Yes, \u201ceasy\u201d is a euphemism for a lot of hard work. But the people you&#39;ll meet and the contacts that you&#39;ll make can reward you and your company in other ways.",
