  "description": "Speakers: Abhishek Narain & Saurabh\n\nIn this topic, we will use Raspberry Pi B+ running Linux and leverage the power of Python to push the sensor/ IoT data on to the Cloud from various sensors (Temperature, Ultrasonic, and Light Sensors - in practical scenarios, the same can be extended to millions of devices). The bigger challenge resides in successfully and securely collecting and analyzing the data from millions of devices in real-time. For this, we will leverage the Cloud power- Azure to do a real-time analytics. Hence, we will discuss on the various IoT Architectures. In our demo, we will use the Gateway Architecture, connecting Arduino to Raspberry Pi/ Galileo which in turn will setup a secure Data communication with the cloud.\n\nDetails: https://in.pycon.org/cfp/pycon-india-2015/proposals/building-nextgen-iot-solutions-using-python-and-cloud/",
