I will elaborate using a simple use case, that defines a reliable service-oriented request-reply dialog between a set of client applications, a broker and a set of worker applications.\n\nDetails: https://in.pycon.org/cfp/pycon-india-2015/proposals/design-distributed-web-applications-using-zeromq/",
