  "description": "Speaker: Sayan Chowdry \nThis talk will introduce FedMsg, it's utility and how it works. FedMsg is the message passing system based on ZeroMQ used by the Fedora project for its infrastructure. Services in Fedora Infrastructure are hooked up with FedMsg to send messages to one another over a message bus instead of communicating with each other in heterogeneous manner. The talk will also demo on how to build apps on top of FedMsg.\n\nDetails: https://in.pycon.org/cfp/pycon-india-2015/proposals/fedmsg-the-message-bus-of-fedora-infrastructure/",
