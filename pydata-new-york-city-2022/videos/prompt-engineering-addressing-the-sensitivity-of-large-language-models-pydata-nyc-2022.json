  "description": "In this talk we analyze what prompt engineering is, how to do it, and how much of a difference it can really make. We do this by comparing different prompts given to multiple large language models (and maybe some vision transformers) and compare the results. We\u2019ll see that by changing key elements of the prompt, the results can be very different. We\u2019ll use results from a research study Mantis has conducted on over 6 different language models with 5 different types of NLP tasks (classification, qa, ner, similarity and summarization).\n\nIn this talk you will learn:\n- How to interact with large language models\n- How to construct a prompt\n- How a smaller model 11b can get close to a 150b model\u2019s results just by using better prompts\n- How prompts can make or break a model\u2019s response\n\nBio:\nPopescu Daniel\nI've been a developer for over a decade now. I have extensive working experience in different areas of IT, and for the last 4 years I've transitioned to Machine Learning, out of passion for the field. I've taken certifications in Machine Learning and competed on Kaggle. I've specialized in Natural Language Processing (NLP), working on multiple projects in which I've learned how to combine the different techniques and models available today, and how to tackle the different problems in the field. I've spent the last 3 years building Intelligent AI assistants by developing NLP and ML approaches for the interface between the human and the device, and using regression methods. My main motivation is making an impact and creating wonderful and innovative products that help others and deliver the best value.\n\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
