  "description": "Many engineers tend to think Python-based backends are not a good solution for highload services. We can't agree and would like to share our experience making it swift and robust. Some of the practices include:\n- labeling optimization based on fast clustering;\n- inference service design;\n- cascades of smart caching, rule-based heuristics, and heavy ML;\n- using Rust for optimizing most latency-affecting functions;\n\nOverall, we'd like to share the principles we follow while designing the system - keeping it fast, maintainable, and easy to change.\n\nThe speech will be interesting for those who design ML-related systems oriented to high load and availability.\n\nBios:\nArseny Kravchenko\nI'm a machine learning engineer, delivering ML projects since 2015 in individual contributor and leadership roles, mainly focusing on deep learning and ML ops-related problems.\n\nThymo ter Doest\nML engineer at Ntropy | Co-founder at AccountingBox | MSc Machine Learning at UCL\n\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
