  "description": "It's only been a couple of years since humanity reached a language technology breakthrough: software that can write as well as humans do. Large language models (LLMs) like GPT and BERT have taken the machine learning world by storm propelling both the language processing (NLP) and computer vision domains rapidly forward and bringing about a series of surprising application (e.g. DeepMind Gopher, OpenAI GPT3 and Dall-E, Google Pathways Language Model). But while big tech invests heavily in including these models into their products, developers and smaller companies still lag in adopting these models and realizing their potential in their business domains.\n\nThis talk provides a gentle and highly visual overview of real-world applications of large language models. It introduces some of the main intuitions to help developers and data scientist who are new to the topic. These include: - how LLMs are trained, - prompt engineering, - embeddings - finetuning\n\nThe talk then proceeds to some advanced use cases and practical tips & tricks for use cases such as: - Building LLM-based text classifiers - Semantic search (going beyond keyword search to searching by meaning) - Document clustering - Generating training data with generative language models\n\nThis talk assumes no prior knowledge of language processing and aims to bring attendees up to date with the fundamental intuitions and applications of large language models.\n\nBio:\nHemant Jain\nI work on Machine Learning Inference at Cohere AI. Prior to this I spent 3 years at NVIDIA developing Triton Inference Server, an open source solution used to deploy machine learning models into production. I have a Masters in Data Science from the University of Washington.\n\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
