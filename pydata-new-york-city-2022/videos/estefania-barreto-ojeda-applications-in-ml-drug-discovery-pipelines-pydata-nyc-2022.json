In addition to unique challenges during the data engineering stage, drug discovery pipelines require not only the standard Git tracking for source code but also make versioning of data and ML models necessary. In this talk, we will discuss some of the main challenges when working with biological data and how Data Version Control (DVC) tools help to facilitate data- and model-tracking during the development of ML drug discovery pipelines.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
