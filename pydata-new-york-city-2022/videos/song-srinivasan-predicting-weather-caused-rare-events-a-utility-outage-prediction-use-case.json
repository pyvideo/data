We discuss best in class approaches to optimize all relevant parameters and continuously improve model performance to deliver accurate actionable results via a highly scalable ML operational environment, enabling them to mitigate effects of climate change. We describe the challenges and approach using the Outage Prediction use case for Utility companies. These companies spend billions of dollars every year restoring power outages, majority of which are weather related. Climate change is creating more frequent and longer lasting power outages and making it harder to predict everyday weather events. Our approach has been used successfully in predicting weather caused outages that are then used to proactively mobilize the power restoration process.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
