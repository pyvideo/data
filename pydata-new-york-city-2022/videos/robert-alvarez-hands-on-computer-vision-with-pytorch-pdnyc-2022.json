  "description": "In this session, we will cover how to create Deep Neural Networks using the PyTorch framework on a variety of examples. The material will range from beginner\u2014understanding what is going on \"under the hood,\" coding the layers of our networks, and implementing backpropagation\u2014to more advanced material on CNNs\n\nBio: \nRobert Alvarez\nRobert loves to break deep technical concepts down to be as simple as possible.\n\nRobert has data science experience in companies both large and small. He is currently VP of Data Science for Podium Education, where he builds models to improve student outcomes, and an Artificial Intelligence Lead at NASA's Frontier Development Lab. Prior to Podium Education, he was a Senior Data Scientist at Metis teaching Data Science and Machine Learning. At Intel, he tackled problems in data center optimization using cluster analysis, enriched market sizing models by implementing sentiment analysis from social media feeds, and improved data-driven decision making in one of the top 5 global supply chains. At Tamr, he built models to unify large amounts of messy data across multiple silos for some of the largest corporations in the world. He earned a PhD in Applied Mathematics from Arizona State University where his research spanned image reconstruction, dynamical systems, mathematical epidemiology and oncology.\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
