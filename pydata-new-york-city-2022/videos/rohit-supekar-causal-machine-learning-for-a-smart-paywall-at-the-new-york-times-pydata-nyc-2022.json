  "description": "The New York Times launched its paywall in March 2011, beginning its journey as a subscription-first news and lifestyle service. Since its inception, this \u201cmetered\u201d access service has been designed so that nonsubscribers can read a fixed number of articles every month before encountering a paywall; this article limit is widely referred to as the \u201cmeter limit.\u201d When the paywall was launched, the meter limit was the same for all users. As The Times has transformed into a data-driven digital company, we are now successfully using a causal machine learning model called the Dynamic Meter to set personalized meter limits and to make the paywall smarter. In doing so, this model optimizes for conversion and engagement while balancing the trade-off between them.\n\nThis talk will discuss how we use causal machine learning at The New York Times to optimize the paywall for conversion and engagement while balancing a trade-off between them. We will also show how our model leverages causal meta-learners and how it is deployed using a tech stack that relies on open source tools.\n\nBio:\nRohit Supekar\nRohit Supekar is a data scientist at The New York Times, and he currently works on developing and deploying causal machine learning models to power The Times\u2019s paywall. He is broadly passionate about understanding the world around us using data, building mathematically rigorous models, and deploying them using modern production-quality engineering tools.\n\nPrior to joining The Times, he obtained a Ph.D. in 2021 and a Master's degree in 2017 from M.I.T., and a Bachelor's degree in 2015 from I.I.T. Madras in India. His Ph.D. thesis work involved building mathematical models for active fluids, such as a dense suspension of bacteria, by using a combination of partial differential equations, machine learning, and principles from fluid mechanics.\n\nOutside of work, Rohit enjoys reading, long-distance running, and alpine skiing.\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
