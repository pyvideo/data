  "description": "Over the past few years we have learned some valuable lessons as a scientific community: that we are stronger together, that we must uplift one another in order to achieve scientific progress, and that the best solutions are found when we work collaboratively.\n\nThese lessons will not spread unless we begin to address the hesitancy in transitioning towards sharing data and results and the lack of applied experience with tools which make open collaboration easier. NASA\u2019s Transform to Open Science (TOPS) is a new mission designed to spark a cultural shift to collaborative, inclusive science.\n\nBio:\nChelle Gentemann\nChelle Gentemann studies the sea from space. The core of her research has been data production and analysis to understand and monitor changes in our weather and climate. Her approach has been to use cutting-edge technologies to bring sweeping changes to data and science, specifically targeting expansions data access and participation in science. At NASA headquarters she leads the Transform to Open Science (TOPS) mission. TOPS will create a scientific culture that is ready for 21st century challenges.\n\n\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
