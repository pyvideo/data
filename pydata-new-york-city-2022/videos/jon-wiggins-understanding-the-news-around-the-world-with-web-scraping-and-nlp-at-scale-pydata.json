  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nEveryday, media companies around the world publish millions of articles spanning multiple languages, and at Chartbeat we process this data to understand what is driving reader engagement. In this talk we discuss real-world lessons learned in building a production pipeline for scraping and extracting metadata in real time from this multitude of news articles. The pipeline leverages a mix of pre-trained and custom-built machine learning models in Python for content extraction, natural language processing, categorization, translation, and entity linking, enabling availability of metadata for an article in just three seconds on average.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
