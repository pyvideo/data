Like with any research environment, responsiveness and easy collaboration are key to keep our users focused on their hypotheses, not the tools they use.\n\nIn this talk I will discuss Two Sigma's partnership with QuantStack's team to deliver direct-to-upstream contributions to improve JupyterLab's performance and furtheir its Real-Time Collaboration (RTC) initiative, all to be soon seen in JupyterLab 4.\n\nBeyond just a teaser of new features to get excited for, this talk is a testimonial of a fruitful and successful relationship between two private entities, Two Sigma and QuantStack, which not only furthers each partner's own internal goals but also improves quality of life of all Jupyter users.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
