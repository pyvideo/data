  "description": "Bio:\nThomas Caswell\nTom Caswell, a trained physicist and staff scientist at NSLS-II at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL), works to bring modern programming and computational tools to the daily life of research scientists. At BNL, Caswell is a founder and core architect of the Bluesky Project which aims to simplify the scaling of particle physics research projects. Caswell is also a regular contributor to many core projects in the Scientific Python ecosystem, and was named a PSF Fellow in Q2 2022 in recognition of his contribution and leadership across the broader Python community.\n\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
