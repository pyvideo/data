A self-service platform of CATs reduces the operational overhead of data product implementation associated with adding new data sources by enabling an Agile / customer centric implementation methodology for collaboration across domains between cross-functional / multi-disciplinary teams of Data Scientists, Data Analysts, Data Engineers, etc. between organizations on products by decentralizing ownership and distributing responsibility to those within bounded domains to support continuous change and scalability.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
