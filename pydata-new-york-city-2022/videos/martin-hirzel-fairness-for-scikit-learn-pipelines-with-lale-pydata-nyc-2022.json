  "description": "The talk will have four sections of roughly equal length, to discuss data, metrics, pipelines, and AutoML.\n\nThe section on fairness and data introduces basic dataset fairness information, including protected attributes and favorable outcomes. You will learn how this information induces intersectionalities on the data, and how to quantify those. One challenge with algorithmic fairness is that results are often not stable across splits; this section shows how to use stratification to ameliorate this problem. Finally, you will learn about correlations between protected attributes, other features, and outcomes, and why naive redaction is insufficient.\n\nThe section on fairness and metrics describes different fairness metrics and their relative merits. You will learn how they compare to various accuracy metrics, against which they are often traded off. You will learn the distinction between metrics on data vs. scorers on models or pipelines, and how those get used in various scikit-learn APIs. Finally, you will learn about some baselines for the values of metrics on a dataset, based on dummy models as well as common off-the-shelf estimators.\n\nThe section on fairness and pipelines starts by covering the behavior of fairness-agnostic scikit-learn estimators. Next, it introduces a variety of bias mitigators, which are operators that either enhance or replace an estimator to make it fairer. You will learn how mitigators interact with preprocessing, and how to use both together effectively. Finally, scikit-learn offers a variety of ensembles including bagging, boosting, voting and stacking. You will learn how to use mitigators with ensembles.\n\nThe section on fairness and AutoML starts by illustrating Pareto frontiers as applied to algorithmic fairness. Next, it will outline difficulties when applying AutoML in a fairness context, in particular, stability and undefined metric values. Next, you will learn how to tune hyperparameters for fairness, including hyperparameters of estimators, preprocessing, mitigators, and ensembles. Finally, you will learn how to also tune algorithm choices in all of these parts of a pipeline for fairness.\n\nBio:\nMartin Hirzel\nMartin Hirzel is a researcher and the manager of the AI Programming Models team at IBM Research AI.

PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
