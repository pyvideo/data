  "description": "At Ntropy we deal with noisy and frequently obfuscated transaction information. We strive to extract as much relevant information as possible from available data sources in order to enrich transactions with data.\n\nFull understanding of the nature of a transaction requires us to obtain correct and useful information on the entities recognized in its description. For this purpose we make use of popular search engines as well as our own company databases. We show how carefully constructed indexes of documents, vector embeddings, together with ranking models help us find relevant pieces of information in the sea of noise and stitch it together into a final form.\n\nWe show how in the environment of cluttered, frequently inaccurate data with very little ground truth, we are able to tweak our heuristics, train models to deliver valuable entity information in performant and robust ways.\n\nWe also discuss how our internal labeling services aid us in this process, and how all of the intricate steps are orchestrated as reusable pipelines.\n\nBio:\nMarcin Ziemi\u0144ski\nI graduated from Theoretical Computer Science at Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w. Since then, I have been designing and developing ML solutions at small to medium size startups. I am currently working at Ntropy where my main focus is entity search.\n\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
