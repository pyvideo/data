  "description": "In this introduction to Apache Beam, we\u2019ll discuss ongoing efforts to support Dask \u2013 and why you should care as a scientist or data practitioner. We'll talk about how both portability and scalability in data engineering are essential to help address the climate crisis. Beam offers a high level way to represent the flow of data, replacing the need for an up-front understanding of low level infrastructure to compute at scale. With a standard programming model that spans execution engines \u2013 and even programming languages \u2013 we\u2019ll demonstrate how one can pivot from HPC to Big Data systems with minimum code change. To illustrate the motivation behind this work, we\u2019ll dissect the needs of the Pangeo Forge project, an open ecosystem for engineering climate datasets, and discuss why they adopted Beam as a Big Data compiler instead of becoming one. From here, we\u2019ll explore the generality of the Dask and Beam solution to enable composable, scalable, and portable science in Python.\n\nBio:\nAlex Merose\nAlex is a senior software engineer at Google Research focused on democratizing climate & weather data.\n\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
