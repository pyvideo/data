Simulations are increasingly important in machine learning, with applications that include simulating the spread of COVID-19 to make decisions about public policy, vaccination and shutdowns.\n\nYou can use simulation to answer questions like, Can you increase profits by adding more tables or staff to your restaurant? You can also use simulation to create data for modeling when it's hard or impossible to get (e.g. simulate purchases in response to promotions on certain products to see if they increase sales).\n\nTo benefit from this talk, you'll need to know a small amount of Python, specifically how to write functions and simple classes. No previous knowledge of simulation needed! If you know about simulation in another language and want to see a SimPy example, you can also benefit from this talk. You'll get a Jupyter notebook with a simple but fully worked out example to follow along with and to study on your own time after the conference.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
