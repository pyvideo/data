With Quarto, you can create dynamic content with Python, R, Julia, and Observable, author documents as plain text markdown or Jupyter notebooks, and output to multiple format types.\n\nQuarto gives you a single tool and framework to create academic articles, reports, reveal.js presentations, websites, blogs, and books. This approach to integrating text and code allows you to posit an idea, test the hypothesis, document your process, and communicate your results. In this talk, I\u2019ll show how we can get Python installed, get started working with Quarto to integrate it into our Python and Jupyter notebook workflows, and share our data science findings on Github.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
