  "description": "Dask is a framework for parallel computing in Python.\nIt's great, until you need to set it up.\n\nKubernetes? Cloud? HPC? SSH? YARN/Hadoop even?\nWhat's the right deployment technology to choose?\n\nAfter you set it up a new set of problems arise:\n-How do you install software across the cluster?\n-How do you secure network access?\n-How do you access secure data that needs credentials?\n-How do you track who uses it and constrain costs?\n-When things break, how do you track them down?\n\nThere exist solutions to these problems in open source packages like dask-kubernetes, helm charts, dask-cloudprovider, and dask-gateway, as well as commercially supported products like Coiled, Saturn, QHub, AWS EMR, and GCP Dataproc. How do we choose?\n\nThis talk describes the problem faced by people trying to deploy any distributed computing system, and tries to construct a framework to help them make decisions on how to deploy.\n\nBio:\nMatthew Rocklin\nMatthew is an open source software developer in the PyData ecosystem. He primarily works on Dask, a library for parallel computing in Python. Matthew worked for Anaconda and NVIDIA before starting a company, Coiled with a mission to enable scalable computing for the Python community.\n\n\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
