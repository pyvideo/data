  "description": "Sharing and explaining the results of your analysis can be a lot easier and much more fun when you can create an animated story of the charts containing your insights. ipyvizzu-story - a new open-source presentation tool for Jupyter & Databricks notebooks and similar platforms - enables just that using a simple Python interface.\n\nIn this tutorial, one of the creators of ipyvizzu-story introduces this tool and helps the audience take the first steps in utilizing the power of animation in data storytelling. After the tutorial, the members can start building and presenting animated data stories independently.\n\nAfter a brief introduction to the technology, participants will see a step-by-step walkthrough of creating an interactive, animated data story within Jupyter.\n\nOutline of the tutorial:\n- Introduction to Vizzu, the open-source C++/JavaScript lib behind ipyvizzu\n- Key concepts when using a generic chart building and morphing engine.\n- The four essential parts of the animate method - the central element of ipyvizzu-story\n- Adding data with and without using pandas\n- Chart configuration options\n- Styling\n- Animation options\n- Building a story (slides, steps)\n- Q&A\n\nBio:\nPeter Vidos\nPeter is the CEO & Co-Founder of Vizzu.\n\nHis primary focus is finding and utilizing use cases matching Vizzu's innovative data visualization approach. Peter has been involved with digital product development for over 15 years. He worked on products covering mobile app testing, online analytics, data visualization, e-learning & educational administration. Still, building a selfie teleport for fun is what he likes to brag about when asked to share previous experiences.\n\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
