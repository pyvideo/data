  "description": "With Artificial Intelligence tools such as DALL\u00b7E 2 and GPT-3 in the news for their mind-blowing image and text generation capabilities, concerned Twitter users, media outlets, and practitioners of both disciplines are wondering - could AI slowly but surely replace creatives? But instead of pitting machines against creatives, this interactive talk would like to invite you to reframe data science as an inherently creative discipline beyond these current, buzz-worthy applications and outputs.\n\nAt Wunderman Thompson's Global Creative Data Group, we have comfortably nestled into the intersection of data and creativity. Our team of developers, designers, creative technologists, and data scientists builds data-inspired & data-fueled creative prototypes and products. Most recently, Speaking in Color, an AI-powered, voice-controlled tool we developed that produces colors based on human inspiration, won the inaugural Creative B2B Lion at the 2022 Cannes Festival of Creativity.\n\nBut reframing working with data as both an art and a science is not just helpful if you're collaborating (and want to get along) with designers and creative technologists on a daily basis. This interactive talk will invite you to think of data science as a creative discipline, from approach (which resources, tools and methods do we use?) and process (how do we work?) to output (what is the data telling us, and what can we build with this?) and communication (who do we talk to about our work, and how do we talk to them?).\n\nDuring this talk, you will also learn how you can make each stage of your data science process a little more creative, no matter what your daily work looks like. And you will get another perspective on whether AI is truly about to replace creatives - or merely opening up new avenues for collaboration.\n\nBio:\nIlinca Barsan\nIlinca Barsan is a director of data science at Wunderman Thompson. A founding member of Wunderman Thompson\u2019s Global Creative Data Group and a social scientist by training, she has an overactive imagination and a passion for weird side projects, storytelling with data, and that sweet spot where code and creativity collide. Ilinca was born in Romania, grew up in Germany, and is currently based in New York after stints in Singapore and London. She has an MSc in Social Science of the Internet from the Oxford Internet Institute, with a specialization in network science.\n\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
