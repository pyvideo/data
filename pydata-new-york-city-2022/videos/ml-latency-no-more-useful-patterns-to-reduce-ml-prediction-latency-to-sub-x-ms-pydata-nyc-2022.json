  "description": "ML Latency is an all-too-common issue with ML system. Don't let this kill your product. So, how do we minimize the prediction serving latency of ML systems? Here are some critical questions to ask yourself before starting your next ML project:\n\n1) Does it need to be less than 100ms or offline?\n2) Do you know your approximate \u201coptimizing\u201d and \u201csatisficing\u201d metrics thresholds?\n3) Did you verify that your input features can be looked up in a low-read-latency DB?\n4) Could you find everything that can be precomputed and cached?\n\nIn this talk, we will cover battle-tested strategies and tactics that will benefit your current ML project as well as your future ML career.\n\nFirst, we will figure out the differences between Online vs Offline and Real-time vs Batch predictions. Then, we will look at the pros and cons of Async vs Sync strategies for ML serving. Finally, we will look at features pre-computation tactics as well as prediction caching strategies.\n\nMore than a quick-fix talk, this presentation will provide you with a map to navigate the multitude of patterns that are available to you to optimize your next ML serving pipeline.\n\nGet a head start today and check the companion blog post: https://towardsdatascience.com/ml-latency-no-more-9176c434067b\n\nBio:\nMoussa Taifi\nMoussa Taifi is currently a Senior Data Science Platform Engineer II at Xandr-Microsoft.\nHe holds a PhD in Computer and Information Science from Temple university. He is a machine learning and big data systems engineer, focused on data science productivity, reliability, performance and cost. He is interested in designing and implementing large scale AI products, through data collection, analysis and warehousing.\n\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
