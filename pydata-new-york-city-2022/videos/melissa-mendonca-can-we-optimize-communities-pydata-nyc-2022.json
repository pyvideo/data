  "description": "Many open source communities are working towards changing their contributor base to be either more reflective of their user base, or to be more diverse and equitable in general. This involves a few actions such as implementing (and enforcing) codes of conduct, explicit internal governance and adapting communication guidelines to be more inclusive. However, change is slow and it can be discouraging to not see the results immediately. In this talk, I am proposing a conversation around what we can improve in these efforts, how we can better make use of new or existing funding opportunities and how to manage these changes internally. This talk is based on the current work me, Inessa Pawson and Noa Tamir are doing in four scientific Python communities: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib and pandas.\n\nBio:\nMelissa Mendon\u00e7a\nMelissa is an applied mathematician and former university professor who fell in love with open source communities. She has been involved with the Python and PyData communities for some time, with a focus on outreach, education and DEI. She works at Quansight as a Senior Developer Experience Engineer, is a maintainer for NumPy and SciPy, and believes in the power of contributions beyond code.\n\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
