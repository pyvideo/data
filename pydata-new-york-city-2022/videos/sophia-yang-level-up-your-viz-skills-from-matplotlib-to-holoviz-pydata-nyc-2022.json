  "description": "This talk will start from your familiar Matplotlib syntax and transition to the HoloViz syntax. You will learn how to build visualizations easily even for big and multidimensional data, how to turn nearly any notebook into a deployable dashboard, and how to build interactive drill-down exploratory tools for your data and models without having to run a web-technology software development project.\n\nBio:\nSophia Yang\nSophia Yang is a Senior Data Scientist at Anaconda, Inc., where she uses data science to facilitate decision-making for various departments across the company. She volunteers as a Project Incubator at NumFOCUS to help Open Source Scientific projects grow. She is also the author of multiple Python open-source libraries such as condastats, cranlogs, PyPowerUp, intake-stripe, and intake-salesforce. She holds an M.S. in Statistics and Ph.D. in Educational Psychology from The University of Texas at Austin.\n\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
