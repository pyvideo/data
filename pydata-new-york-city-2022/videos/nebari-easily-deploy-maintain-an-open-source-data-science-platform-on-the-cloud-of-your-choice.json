  "description": "There is a critical need in organizations for a shared data science platform that is flexible, accessible, and scalable. Typically, the choices are using a vendor supplied platform that doesn\u2019t quite fit or spending significant time and engineering effort rolling out a custom solution. In this tutorial, we will walk you through the installation and usage of Nebari, a new open source project that provides an all-in-one development and experimentation platform for teams to work efficiently and collaboratively. Nebari can be installed in as little as 30 mins on your cloud of choice (currently AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean) and can also be installed on-prem. In this tutorial we will walk you through the installation process and core features of Nebari.\n\nNebari (nebari.dev) is an opinionated JupyterHub distribution that integrates many open source libraries into a coherent platform. The components that form Nebari can be rearranged and customized to support many different enterprise use cases. Deployment, integration, and maintenance is minimized by using the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) management approach. Additionally, Nebari integrates functionality that allows organizations to manage data science environments across teams and from research to production. Some of the components included in a Nebari deployment are: VSCode, Dask, Prefect, ClearML, Conda, Grafana, Prometheus, Argo Workflows and Dashboard sharing.\n\nNebari has a DevOps for non-DevOps people approach. For smaller teams and organizations this means that they can deploy and maintain a fully featured data science platform without needing an internal devops team. For larger organizations, Nebari provides a customizable blueprint of how to integrate JupyterHub with the many other open source tools that are typically needed.\n\nIn this tutorial, we will walk attendees through the installation process and then cover several example use cases that demonstrate the various features of Nebari. Since a tutorial that involves cloud deployments can be tricky we plan to have several options for attendees. A pre-installed cloud instance of Nebari will be available for those who wish to just explore features. For those who want to follow along with the installation, we will walk through a local installation or provide temporary cloud credentials. To attend the tutorial, no knowledge of cloud technologies is required. Basic comfort using the command line is needed.\n\nTime breakdown (subject to change)\n- Introduction to Nebari (15 mins)\n- Installation (30 mins)\n- Walkthrough of Nebari Features (30 mins)\n- Q&A (15 mins)\n\nBio:\nEskild Eriksen\nSoftware engineer at Quansight.\n\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
