  "description": "Pandas appears to be a healthy, well maintained library that will continue to serve the data science community for many years to come. However, the strategy for Pandas is at a crossroads and the decisions we make about its future will have influence far beyond Two Sigma.\n\nWe'll learn about the history of pandas, from its inception as a data analysis library, to the explosive growth as an open source library. We\u2019ll discuss how the growth of big data and big compute challenges panda\u2019s capabilities and is a threat to its continued dominance in the market. Finally, we\u2019ll talk about the crossroads; which paths we are considering at Twos Sigma, and how others can get involved.\n\nBio:\nJeff Reback\nAs a former quant Jeff Reback has much experience in building financial trading systems, using python and working with very large data. He has been a core committer to the pandas project since 2011, and has managed the project since 2013. Jeff is a Managing Director at Two Sigma, overseeing the research environment. Jeff holds a B.S. in Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
