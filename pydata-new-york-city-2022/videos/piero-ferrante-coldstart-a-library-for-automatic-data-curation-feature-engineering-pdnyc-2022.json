  "description": "Data curation and cleaning are undoubtedly among the most time-consuming steps in the data science lifecycle, so why are we constantly rewriting the same queries and/or data pipelines across projects and teams when the features are the same? Alas, there is a better way\u2026 Coldstart is a package for automatic data curation that exposes a high-level convenience function for retrieving data from various user-defined domains by establishing 1:1 or 1:M relationships with queries that are templated at runtime based on parameters and executed concurrently.\n\nBio:\nPiero Ferrante\nPiero Ferrante is a Senior Principal Data Scientist at CVS Health, a Fortune 4 health solutions company, where he and his team are focused on building scalable machine learning systems and developing tools to enhance the productivity and efficacy of hundreds of fellow data scientists and engineers.\n\nPiero has nearly 15 years of applied experience in healthcare, telecom, insurance, mobile advertising, and fintech at companies ranging in size from unicorn startups to Fortune 500s. He holds an M.S. in Predictive Analytics from Northwestern University, a B.S. in Finance and Management Information Systems from the University of Delaware, and has served as an adjunct at New York University, the University of Kansas, and Rockhurst University. Piero also advises Play-it Heath, a digital health startup, on algorithms and data strategy.\n\n\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
