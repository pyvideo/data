  "description": "Dolt is Git for data: a new kind of SQL database that you can branch and merge, push and pull, fork and clone just like a git repository. Learn how to use Dolt to add reproducibility and a wealth of other version control benefits to your data processing pipeline.\n\nDoltHub is GitHub for data: a place where you can host Dolt databases for free, others can clone and fork them, submit pull requests to improve your data, and bunch of other features.\n\nDolt is free and open source, and DoltHub is free for public databases.\n\nThe talk includes a live demo of using Dolt to manage branching and merging a data set, and as well as showing you how to upload changes to DoltHub and open a pull request for your team to review.\n\nBio:\nZach Musgrave\nZach leads development for Dolt, the world's first SQL database that you can fork and clone, branch and merge, push and pull just like a git repository. Zach studied computer science at the University of Washington, and spent the first 13 years of his career split between Amazon and Google before joining DoltHub. He's a fierce advocate for the value of client-side software in a server-side world.\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
