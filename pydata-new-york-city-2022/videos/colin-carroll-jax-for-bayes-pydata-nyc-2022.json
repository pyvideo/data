  "description": "JAX is a high performance library for doing machine learning (with gradients!) on GPU/TPU. There is a thriving ecosystem of composable libraries for doing Bayesian inference that work with JAX. Specifically, there are libraries designed for expressing a Bayesian model, and libraries designed for fitting those models, and they are easy to mix-and-match.\n\nThis talk walks through doing exactly that: implementing a regression model for classification with five different libraries, and then running inference using four libraries. This talk is primarily an API tour of the Bayesian ecosystem, but some intuition for the MCMC algorithms being used and enabled by JAX's autodiff and vmap will also be provided.\n\nWhether you are looking for a simple way to implement and fit well understood models, experimenting with new bespoke models, keeping up with library design, or actively doing research in Bayesian computation, there is something for you here.\n\nBio:\nColin Carroll\nColin Carroll is a software engineer at Google Research. In this role he focuses Bayesian computation and research, and contributes to a number of open source libraries, including TensorFlow Probability, PyMC[3], and ArviZ. He received his PhD in mathematics from Rice University, where he researched geometric measure theory.\n\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
