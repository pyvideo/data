  "description": "At Stitch Fix, a data science team\u2019s feature generation process was causing them iteration & operational frustrations in delivering time-series forecasts for the business. In this talk I\u2019ll present Hamilton, a novel open source Python framework that solved their pain points by changing their working paradigm.\n\nSpecifically, Hamilton enables a simpler approach for data science & data engineering teams to create, maintain, execute, and scale both the human and computational sides of feature/data transforms.\n\nAt a high level, we will cover:\n- What Hamilton is and why it was created\n- How to use it for feature engineering\n- The software engineering best practices Hamilton prescribes that make pipelines more sustainable\n- How Hamilton enables out-of-the-box scaling with common distributed compute frameworks\n\nAt a low level, through code in the slides and a quick demo, you will learn:\n- How a data science team at Stitch Fix scaled their team and code base with Hamilton to enable documentation-friendly, unit-testable code\n- What Hamilton is and how the declarative paradigm it prescribes offers advantages over more traditional approaches\n- How you can easily add runtime data quality checks to ensure the robustness of your pipeline\n- How the Ray/Dask/Spark integrations with Hamilton works and how they can help you scale your data\n\nBio: \nElijah ben Izzy\nElijah has always enjoyed working at the intersection of math and engineering. More recently, he has focused his career on building tools to make data scientists more productive. At Two Sigma, he was building infrastructure to help quantitative researchers efficiently turn ideas into production trading models. At Stitch Fix he leads the Model Lifecycle team \u2014 a team that focuses on streamlining the experience for data scientists to create and ship machine learning models. In his spare time, he enjoys geeking out about fractals, poring over antique maps, and playing jazz piano.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
