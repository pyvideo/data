  "description": "In this talk, we will explore the replacement of a legacy C++ engine at a large, multinational bank with a modern, scalable solution while taking into account technical, stakeholder and policy constraints. The existing technology fails to process data at the scale required in order to make informed decisions. We demonstrated the ability to scale using the PyData stack and met the bank\u2019s requirements.\n\nOur team was tasked with building a distributed compute environment that could be used to run valuation adjustment models for a large multinational bank. The bank used a single threaded C++ codebase to create and run these valuation adjustment models. This legacy system fails to process data at the scale required by the bank to make informed decisions. For a single set of models, this process involved loading and summing up 14,000 files consisting of 6 million rows each (24.5 TB). Then, the results are run through one or more valuation adjustment models before the final sets of data can be generated. In the future, the bank wants to be able to process 1,400+ model sets. We experimented with several scaling solutions using several architectures (GPU, SQL Engines, etc.) and settled on a solution that scales sufficiently using Dask. This talk explores our learning process building out this solution while taking into account technical, stakeholder and policy constraints. During this process we tested OmnisciDB(Heavy.AI), RAPIDS, BlazingSQL, Dask, Prefect and Argo Workflows, among many other solutions. In this talk we will present our solutions to remedy these issues, leading to the successful implementation and deployment of a modernized HPC Cluster.\n\nBios:\nAnirrudh Krishnan\nAnirrudh is a senior software engineer at Quansight, working on problems ranging from computation to full stack application development.

PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
