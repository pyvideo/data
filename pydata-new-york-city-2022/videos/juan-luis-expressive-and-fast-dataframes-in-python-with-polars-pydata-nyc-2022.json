  "description": "The outline of the talk goes as follows:\n\n-We will make a very brief introduction to pandas, we will talk about its importance, and we will point out some of its shortcomings (as its own creator did half a decade ago (10 minutes)\n-We will enumerate some of the current pandas alternatives and classify them (pandas-like vs bespoke, single-node vs distributed) (5 minutes)\n-We will do a live demo of how to analyze and manipulate a relatively big dataset using Polars inside Orchest Cloud y and showcase some of its unique capabilities (20 minutes).\n-Recommendations and conclusions (5 minutes).\n\nAfter the talk, you will have more information on how some of the modern alternatives to pandas fit into the ecosystem, and will understand why Polars is so exciting and promising. Prior exposure to data manipulation with Python (not necessarily with pandas) will help make the most of the presentation.\n\nThe talk will build upon this blog post about Polars.\n\nBio:\nJuan Luis\nJuan Luis (he/him/\u00e9l) is an Aerospace Engineer with a passion for STEM, programming, outreach, and sustainability. He works as Data Scientist Advocate at Orchest, where he empowers data scientists by building an open-source, scalable, easy-to-use workflow orchestrator. He has worked as Developer Advocate at Read the Docs, as software engineer in the space, consulting, and banking industries, and as a Python trainer for several private and public entities.\n\nApart from being a long-time user and contributor to many projects in the scientific Python stack (NumPy, SciPy, Astropy) he has published several open-source packages, the most important one being poliastro, an open-source Python library for Orbital Mechanics used in academia and industry.\n\nFinally, Juan Luis is the founder and former chair of the Python Espa\u00f1a association, the point of contact for the Spanish Python community, former organizer of PyCon Spain, which attracted more than 800 attendees in its last in-person edition in 2019, and current organizer of the PyData Madrid monthly meetups.\n\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
