Whoosh is a fast, pure Python search engine library.You can use Whoosh anywhere you can use Python, no compiler or Java required.\n\nWhat is Whoosh?\n\nWhoosh is a fast, pure Python search engine library.\n\nThe primary design impetus of Whoosh is that it is pure Python. You should be able to use Whoosh anywhere you can use Python, no compiler or Java required. Like one of its ancestors, Lucene, Whoosh is not really a search engine, it\u2019s a programmer library for creating a search engine. Practically no important behavior of Whoosh is hard-coded. Indexing of text, the level of information stored for each term in each field, parsing of search queries, the types of queries allowed, scoring algorithms, etc. are all customizable, replaceable, and extensible.",
