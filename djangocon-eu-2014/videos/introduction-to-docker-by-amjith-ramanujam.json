  "description": "Docker is an open source tool that simplifies managing Linux containers.\nA container is a sandbox environment that runs a collection of\nprocesses. Containers are light-weight VMs that share the same kernel as\nthe host OS.\n\nDocker adds some niceties to Linux containers such as AUFS, version\ncontrol, docker registry (repository), versioning etc. This talk will\nserve as an introduction to working with docker tools. I'll cover the\nbasic concepts behind docker and explain the difference between a docker\ncontainer and a VM. Show a demo of how easy it is to create a docker\nimage and launch a container from it. Briefly explain the idea behind\nDockerfile and show some examples.\n\nI'll cover how networking and filesystem changes are handled in Docker.\nShow a demo of how to deploy a Django application in docker and explain\nwhy it's useful to do so in production.\n\nI'll also cover some common use cases of docker in the industry such as\ntesting, deployment, PAAS etc.\n",
