  "description": "While User Experience Design (UXD) may seem like another buzzword, it\nactually has deep roots in usability, visual design, information\narchitecture, and many other areas that developers and the like may\nalready be familiar with. UXD is not just another process, but instead a\nway of thinking and collaborating that should not be overlooked for cost\nor time reasons.\n\nAs companies continue to put more pressure on their employees to do more\nwith less, decision makers, product managers and developers are looking\nfor ways to solve problems quickly, while still getting high value for\nthe company and their customers. With changing technologies, strategies\nand markets, and a constant push for employees to wear multiple hats and\nwork more collaboratively, having an amazing user experience is becoming\na \"must have\" for companies that want to remain competitive.\n\nDevelopers, product managers and decision makers who are new to UXD and\ncurious to learn more will walk away with a clear definition of User\nExperience Design, a knowledge of its goals and the basic components\nthat make up a UX project, such as: User Research, UI Design, Front End\nDevelopment, and Content Strategy. Attendees will also walk away with\nexamples of how UXD can add value to a project for both the business and\nthe users.\n",
