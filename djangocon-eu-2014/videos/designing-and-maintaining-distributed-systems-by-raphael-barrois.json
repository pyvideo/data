  "description": "As projects grow, they tend to mutate into complex, monolithic\napplications ; that's where the team splits them into loosely coupled\nmodules talking over the network (a.k.a a service-oriented\narchitecture).\n\nThis talk will focus on a few key points for a successful \"monolithic to\ndistributed\" transition:\n\n-  Setting clean and logical boundaries between services\n-  Providing a seamless integration to service users (SSO, merging\n   views, ...)\n-  Performing a smooth transition when a service turns remote\n-  Choosing suitable protocols for communications (spoiler alert: avoid\n   SOAP/XML :p)\n-  Stubbing versus integration testing, tips and tricks\n",
