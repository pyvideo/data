  "description": "What is the only thing that really matters?\n\nWe are programmers, and everything in the ideology of our industry is\ndisembodied and virtualised. At the same time we are building the world\nthat the rest of the world, increasingly, will live in.\n\nWe are, it seems, sexless selves and disembodied minds in a world that\ndoesn't need our bodies and isn't very interested in them.\n\nAnd yet: the body remains at the centre of the world, even this\nsupposedly bodiless world. Its disputes and politics, its hurts and\ncontroversies, its pains and insults all belong to the body.\n\nEven the fiction and film of this new world of the unbodied are (and\nalways have been) bodily-fixated.\n\nIn short, there's no escaping the body.\n\nIn this talk, I take examples from history, literature, film, poetry and\nother fields to show how our present state can be woven into a very\nancient pattern, and ask: what should we, as programmers, do about it?\n\nAnd finally, I make a modest attempt to answer that question.\n",
