  "description": "Pretty much every website is underpinned by a database or two - and how\nyou're storing data in there really matters. This talk will cover the\nbest ways to set up your schema to store your data, how to change your\nschema without any downtime, and how to use the brand-new migration\nfeatures in Django 1.7 to your best advantage.\n\nWe'll take a look at database normalisation (and why it's not always a\ngood idea), denormalisation, schemaless data, how to best set up your\ntables and indexes for different load types (heavy read/heavy\nwrite/balanced), and how to scale up your database and its schema as you\ngrow.\n",
