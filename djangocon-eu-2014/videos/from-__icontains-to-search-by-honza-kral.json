  "description": "Good search experience for your users is about more than just a more\nefficient way to find models containing certain word or phrase. In this\ntalk we'll go through what are the relevant parts of search and how to\nbest implement them (we'll use Elasticsearch for actual examples).\n\nWe will start discussing data modelling, moving on to simple search, add\nfacets for easier navigation and discoverability, spell checking (\"did\nyou mean?\") and auto-complete. In the remaining time we'll see about\npossibilities for further enhancing your search by tracking user\nsearches or providing stored search functionality.\n",
