  "description": "I'll tell how do matters stand with transition to Python 3, why should it transition and how (on my mind) transition to it. Knowledge can be applied on practice at the same day. We'll be porting several libraries on evening workshop/sprint. I hope that after the report and the workshop everyone's skill of porting code on Python 3 is systematized. This skill will become necessary soon for reading majority popular project's code for example and for benefit of the World Civilization, why not?:-)   \n",
