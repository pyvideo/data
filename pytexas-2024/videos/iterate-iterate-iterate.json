  "description": "Iterate, Iterate, Iterate!\n\nThe iteration protocol and generators are Python's power tools. Properly used, they allow for clearer code that is easier to debug and understand. The talk will cover the iteration protocol itself, generator functions and expressions, the itertools and more_itertools libraries, and how to use them to up your Python level.\n\nSpeaker: Moshe Zadka\n\nMoshe has been involved in the Linux community since 1998, helping in Linux \"installation parties\". They have been programming Python since 1999, and has contributed to the core Python interpreter. Moshe has been a DevOps/SRE since before those terms existed, caring deeply about software reliability, build reproducibility and other such things. They have worked in companies as small as three people and as big as tens of thousands -- usually some place around where software meets infrastructure.",
