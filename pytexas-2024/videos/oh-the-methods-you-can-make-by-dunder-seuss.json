  "description": "Oh the (Methods) You Can (Make): By Dunder Seuss\n\nYou can make many methods\nOver 100 to be exact\nThat start with two underscores\nWhat do you think of that?\n\nThe runtime, it calls these\nAt points A or B\nTo do special magic\nAt runtime, you see.\n\nYou may have seen _getattr_ or _init_\n\nBut __rfloordiv__? What's the point of it?\n\nCome take a quick tour, your mother won't mind\nAnd hear a talk that's one-of-a-kind\nAbout how Python uses them under-the-hood\nAnd how you can use them to write code that's real good\n\nSpeaker: Joshua Cannon\n\nHowdy y'all! Sometimes I'm a Build Engineer and talk your ear off about tools and developer experience. Sometimes I go by \"Dunder Seuss\" and perform \"edutainment\" about Python itself. But mostly I'm just here to have fun and enjoy the company of others.",
