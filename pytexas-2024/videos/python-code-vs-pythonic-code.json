  "description": "Python Code vs. Pythonic Code: What Experienced Developers Find Challenging About Learning Python\n\nPython has a reputation for being very easy to learn. Despite this, experienced developers often struggle with working as effectively with Python (e.g., writing Pythonic code) as they are with other programming languages with which they are more familiar. This talk will leverage the experiences of a professional trainer to demystify this dichotomy with the goal of understanding the motivating reasons for it, and making suggestions on how to help developers new to Python move quickly from writing Python code to writing Pythonic code.\n\nSpeaker: Heather Crawford\n\nHeather Crawford is an Engineering Technical Trainer at Bloomberg and a former university professor. In her roles as a professional educator, she has taught learners at many levels from university students at all levels to both entry-level and experienced software engineers. Heather is a Python lover, who has used it since 2007.",
