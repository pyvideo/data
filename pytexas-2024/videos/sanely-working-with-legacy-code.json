  "description": "Sanely Working with Legacy Code\n\nFor many developers, they will inevitably have to work with legacy code at some point in their careers. It requires a different set of skills to navigate these codebases as opposed to greenfield code where you start with a clean slate. Join me in exploring techniques to approach legacy code including how to improve documentation, increase testing coverage, refactoring code into smaller more testable units and techniques when you lack time to add tests.\n\nSpeaker: Joe Cabrera\n\nI am a software engineer with +10 years of professional experience building scalable and distributed systems for companies. I am also a subject matter expert in Information Retrieval and Personalized Search. I have spoken at several Python conferences, helped to organize a conference and am involved in the Python open source community.",
