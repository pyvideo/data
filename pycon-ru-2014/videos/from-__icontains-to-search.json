  "description": "Good search experience is about more than just finding matching substring, \nand in this talk I would like to present how it actually works. We will build \nout a model of a search engine and analyze the result - what sort of functionality \nand characteristics will the resulting engine have? What features can we implement \non top of it?  \n\nMost of the talk will be generic but there will be some concrete examples from \nElasticsearch. At the end of the talk there will be time for questions regarding \nanything search related.",
