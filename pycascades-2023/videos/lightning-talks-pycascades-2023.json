It also provides tools for downloading collections of files, useful for managing sample datasets for scientific and data-processing Python packages. Currently Pooch is being used by well-known libraries like SciPy, scikit-learn, Xarray and scikit-image, amongst others.\n\nSpeaker: Andres Pineda\nLightning Talk: Invite to Pycon Latam",
