  "description": "One of the things that makes Python easy to work with is that you don't need a compile step before you can check that your code works. What if you could skip the save and run steps, too? Live coding lets you constantly run your code, as you edit it, and shows you what's happening inside. It's also great for visual tools like Matplotlib and Pillow.\n\nI'll be demonstrating my Live Coding in Python project that includes plugins for PyCharm, Emacs, and SublimeText, as well as live tutorials that use Pyodide to let the reader experiment with code samples right in the browser.",
