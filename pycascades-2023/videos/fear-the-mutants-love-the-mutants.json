  "description": "Code coverage is a great metric - how much of your code is actually tested by your unit tests. However, this doesn\u2019t tell you how good your tests actually are at picking up changes to your codebase - if your tests aren\u2019t well thought-out, it\u2019s possible for changes to get past your unit tests but break production.\n\nMutation testing is a great (and massively underrated) way to understand how valuable your tests are. Mutation score quantifies how much trust you should put in your tests to stop mutant versions of your code escaping from your lab and wreaking havoc in production. In this talk, I\u2019ll show you examples of how to get started with mutation testing and how to integrate it into your CI/CD pipeline.\n\nAfter the session, you\u2019ll be ready to use mutation testing with wild abandon and you'll be ready to integrate it into your release engineering process, testing your mutant code without needing to set foot in the lab at all!",
