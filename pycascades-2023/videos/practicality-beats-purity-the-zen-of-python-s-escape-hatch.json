  "description": "The Zen of Python, the well known list of 20 Python aphorisms (of which only 19 are written down), contains a lot of prescriptive advice for what makes \"Good\" Python code\u2026 or it would, if one of them didn't give you permission to ignore the rest of them.\n\nFocusing on one piece of the 19 aphorisms, this talk explores the contradictions in the Zen of Python's advice, and how even with prescriptive rules, writing \"Good\" Python remains a subjective exercise.",
