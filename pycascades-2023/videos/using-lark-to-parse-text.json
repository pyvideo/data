  "description": "Parsing tools aren't just for compilers! You can use parsing tools to read, parse, and manipulate all sorts of data. We'll use Lark, a Python parsing library, to look at some basic examples and the resulting parse trees, demonstrating the end-to-end process of input, parse tree, and output.\n\nThis talk is for anyone that has used Python to read in data from a text file.",
