  "description": "\u2705 Discover efficient methods for Sending Images to GPU at the #Py4AI conference with Francesco S. Zuppichini - Senior ML Engineer at Zurich Insurance. A masterclass in optimizing image processing workflows.\n\n\"In this talk, we are going to review various techniques and trade-offs for handling images within a computer vision pipeline. We'll discuss how memory functions and how we can leverage it to accelerate dataset creation and parsing. We will also cover how to maximize throughput when transmitting images to the GPU, as well as when and which data augmentations can be applied in which device.\"\n\n#imageprocessing #GPU #techtalks #Py4AI #techconference",
