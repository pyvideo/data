  "description": "We all want to create docs that help our users. We know good research\nhelps us to give our readers what they need and poor research can weaken\nour docs so it\u2019s time to step up our research game.\n\nGrounded in the things I\u2019ve learnt (read: mistakes I\u2019ve made) from my\ntime writing open source documentation for the UK government at\nGovernment Digital Service (GDS), this talk will look at:\n\n-  deciding what - and how - to research\n-  interviewing, simulation and content evaluation techniques\n-  distinguishing user \u2018needs\u2019 from \u2018wants\u2019\n-  how the Hawthorne effect can influence research\n-  how to feed findings into product and content development\n\nThroughout it all, we\u2019ll cover strategies to avoid common pitfalls, how\nto avoid users telling you what you want to hear, how to manage research\nwith no extra budget and, when it\u2019s all done, how to turn all that\nqualitative data into tangible content changes that have a genuine\nimpact for users.\n",
