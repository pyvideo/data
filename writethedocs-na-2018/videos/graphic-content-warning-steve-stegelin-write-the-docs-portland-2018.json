  "abstract": "There are multiple reasons to use screenshots, from introducing new\nfeatures and helping confirm the context of content to simply breaking\nup walls of text. However, screenshots can carry a lot of overhead,\nincluding localization considerations and short shelf-lives due to\ncontinuous deployment, which may make them more effort than their worth.\nFor content that appears in context of the UI, screenshots can also be\nredundant and unnecessary. As alternatives to screenshots, there are\nseveral visual content strategies to consider to engage audiences and\nconvey and complement concepts and UIisms, including infographics,\nillustrations, and abstract \"simplified UI (SUI)\" representations. Which\nyou use depends on your intent and message.\n",
