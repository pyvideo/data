  "description": "Ah, good old FAQs: the internet\u2019s native documentation format. In this\ntalk, we\u2019ll explore various questions we might frequently ask ourselves\nabout FAQs, such as:\n\n-  Why do readers always seem to want them even though they\u2019re routinely\n   out of date?\n-  Why do some readers ignore our carefully crafted pages and use these\n   giant walls of text as a starting point instead?\n-  What are some strategies for keeping FAQs up to date?\n-  What\u2019s the #1 thing FAQs do RIGHT?\n-  How can we make FAQs more user-friendly?\n-  Do we even actually need FAQs?\n\n(Caution: May contain opinions.)\n",
