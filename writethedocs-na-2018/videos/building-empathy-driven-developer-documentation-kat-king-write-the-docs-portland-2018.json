  "abstract": "Ever lie awake at night wondering, How do we know if our documentation\nis any good? What does \u201cgood\u201d mean, anyway? Well, you\u2019re not alone - but\nthe good news is, there\u2019s a way to find out! The secret lies in caring\nabout your developers and actively working to learn how your docs serve\nthem (or don\u2019t!)\n\nIn this talk, I\u2019ll share the story of Twilio\u2019s journey toward\nempathy-driven documentation. By leveraging direct user feedback, user\nexperience research, and constantly testing the effectiveness of the\ndocs you provide, you can learn how your users work with (and wish they\ncould work with) your docs.\n\nAlong the way I\u2019ll share a few tips about what worked well for us, what\nideas didn\u2019t pan out, and some of the documentation principles we\u2019re now\nsold on.\n",
