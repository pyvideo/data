  "abstract": "Years of being one of the \"technical people\" in activist circles\nresulted in my being continually called on to help community groups and\nfellow organizers understand and more correctly wield technology in\nservice of their mission. Using my blogpost \"Three Tips for Providing\nTech Help to Non-Profits and Other Such Organizations\" as a point of\ndeparture, I will share my experience and derived best practices.\n\nFrom \"basics\", like how to use documents and spreadsheets, to working\nwith databases and understanding security, I have given assistance to a\ngreat many groups and the most important part is always the\ndocumentation that I leave behind. I can rarely ever just point people\nto the official software or open source project documentation, I almost\nalways have to rewrite the docs for them in simple language that\nreferences their specific use case.\n\nI wish to help community and activist groups make better technical\nchoices so that they feel more in control of the technologies they use.\nMy hope is that in sharing my experiences, I can engage in a deeper\ndialogue with the technical documentation community about how we can\nmake technical documentation more accessible, easier to re-use, and\nempowering.\n",
