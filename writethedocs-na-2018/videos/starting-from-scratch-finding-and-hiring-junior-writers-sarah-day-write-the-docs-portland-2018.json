  "abstract": "Our team has the classic documentation problem--a huge backlog of work\nand not enough writers. Enter the documentation internship program,\nwhich connected us with junior and aspiring technical writers and got us\nheadcount fast.\n\nThis talk will teach you how we recruited, interviewed, and hired\ninexperienced writers, and taught them the basics of technical writing\u2026\nall without damaging our velocity.\n\nI\u2019ll focus specifically on how our job pitch got us applicants from a\nwide array of backgrounds, from screenwriters to college students, how\nwe made sense of the answers we got through an unpredictable set of\ninterviews, and how we onboarded writers with strong skills and\naptitude, but no real-world experience.\n",
