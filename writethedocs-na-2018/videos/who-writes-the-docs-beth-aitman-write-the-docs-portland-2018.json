  "description": "In the wider tech writer world, it\u2019s still common to hear tech writers\nbe certain that developers can\u2019t write good help: the prevailing sense\nis \u201cOnly we can do this.\u201d But those same tech writers often feel under\nthreat in their jobs - feeling like their organisation doesn\u2019t see their\nvalue, doesn\u2019t understand what they do.\n\nWho *should* write the docs? Should all developers write docs as a\nmatter of course? Is it even worthwhile having specialist writers?\n\nIn this talk I\u2019ll try to find some answers to these questions, based on\nmy experience working in many teams - both in teams that have valued\ntech writing and in teams that haven\u2019t. I\u2019ll talk about the\n\u2018documentarian\u2019 mindset and how that contributes to better software, no\nmatter what your job title is.\n\nI\u2019ll also explore the benefits that come from specialist writers and\ngeneralist developers working together. And I\u2019ll share the ways I\u2019ve\nfound that people with specialist writer skills (whether they\u2019re\ndevelopers, tech writers, or other roles) can make the biggest\ndifference to user experience, and through that to their organisations.\n",
