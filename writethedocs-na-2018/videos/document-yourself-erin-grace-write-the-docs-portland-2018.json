  "abstract": "In a tech writer\u2019s career, creating and maintaining a great portfolio is\nas important as it is stressful. What belongs in there? What constitutes\nyour \"best work\"? What if all your work is proprietary? Do you really\nneed a portfolio if you have a great job?\n\nBuilding a portfolio is an exercise in documenting yourself: your\nwriting, your skill, your journey as a professional. Like any other kind\nof documentation, it isn't easy or intuitive to create something great.\nAnd like any other kind of documentation, it's worth doing the hard work\nto get it right.\n\nIn this talk, I cover:\n\n-  Why you need a portfolio even if you have a stable job\n-  How to create a well-rounded portfolio and decide what's your best\n   work\n-  Strategies for adding proprietary work (legally!)\n-  Options to present it that aren't just a series of email attachments\n",
