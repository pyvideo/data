  "abstract": "Congratulations! Someone realizes your awesome product needs equally\nawesome documentation, and you\u2019ve earned the job! It\u2019s an exciting new\nrole, with new goals and challenges.\n\nCue the panic: There are too many things to do! Where do I start? How\ncan I succeed in this role?\n\nI\u2019ve been there before. In fact, I\u2019ve done it multiple times. Like\nmedical triage, you won\u2019t have a lot of time to think before you dive in\nand get to work. It\u2019s stressful, even if there are no lives at stake!\n\nBut you can be fast and smart. I\u2019ll tell you how to get started (audit\nthe existing content, create a list of requirements for documentation\ntools, ruthlessly prioritize a huge list of tasks) and how to keep going\n(build relationships with coworkers in customer-facing roles to learn\nwhat your customers really need from docs, take a moment to pat yourself\non the back every now and then). I\u2019ll also admit to mistakes I\u2019ve made,\nand how I\u2019ve learned to avoid them (like trying to do everything myself,\nor thinking that time spent planning is taking away from \u201creal work\u201d).\n\nYour new role will require hard work, but a bit of advice can help you\nget started, stay motivated, and avoid pitfalls along the way.\n",
