  "abstract": "I\u2019d like to talk about the role of an editor and the art of enabling\nhumans to create, publish and present technical content in a variety of\nmedia. Primarily in text, in the context of a blog or other \u2018managed\u2019\ncalendar-driven web publications. Not technical documentation. Sometimes\nit\u2019s a mighty fine line between docs and blogs, but I think we can and\nshould differentiate.\n\nThis talk will explore principles and patterns of kind, effective\neditorial practice, and nuances of voice, civility, and clear\ncommunication, as they play out when working with a diverse distributed\nroster of authors, many of whom are non-native English speakers or\nfirst-time storytellers.\n\nI believe there\u2019s as much appetite for diversity of voice and point of\nview in blogging about software development as there is in speaking\nabout it at developer conferences. And I\u2019ve got some observations to\nshare about how we can cultivate that.\n",
