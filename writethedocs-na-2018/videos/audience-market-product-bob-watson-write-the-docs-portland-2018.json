  "abstract": "API documentation can been grouped into four classes\u2014Overviews,\nTutorials, How-to topics, and References. Each addresses a different\ncustomer need and each requires different amounts of time and types of\nresources to produce. However, what happens on that fateful day you find\nthat you have more documentation to write than time will allow? (As a\ntechnical writer, I call those weekdays). How can you prioritize which\ndocumentation type and how much of it should be written and which topics\nto write first?\n\nThis talk provides guidance and encouragement to technical writers to\nhelp them get the information they need to strategically get the right\ndocs to the right people at the right time\u2014and learn a little bit more\nabout their stakeholders along the way.\n",
