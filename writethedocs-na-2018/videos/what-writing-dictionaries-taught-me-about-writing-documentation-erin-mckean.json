  "description": "Before becoming a full-time software developer, I spent more than twenty\nyears working on dictionaries and other reference books. Reference books\nand dictionaries have a lot of similarities with documentation: they're\nboth genres of writing that aim to explain and educate, and are aimed at\nan audience that is largely goal-oriented and impatient. In this talk,\nI'll give a little bit of background on how reference books\n(particularly dictionaries and thesauruses) are made, talk about my\nexperience in publishing has informed writing documentation and\ntutorials (and working with Swagger/OpenAPI), and give some examples of\nhabits I had to un-learn, too!\n",
