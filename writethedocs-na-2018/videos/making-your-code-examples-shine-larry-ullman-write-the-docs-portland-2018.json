  "abstract": "Thorough and optimal technical documentation often requires not just an\nAPI reference of endpoints and parameters, or long contextual\ninstructions, but also code examples that users can cut and paste into\ntheir applications. As a technical writer at Stripe, I\u2019m partially\nresponsible for maintaining 150 code examples, each of which needs to be\nin 8 programming languages. In this presentation, I\u2019ll explain the\nprocesses we\u2019re using, the hurdles we\u2019re facing, and the solutions we\u2019ve\ndevised thus far to make and maintain code examples that really shine.\n\nSpecific concepts covered include:\n\n-  Defining a style guide for your code\n-  Generating code examples programmatically\n-  Testing examples to ensure they work\n-  Using common snippets to save time\n-  Enhancing examples for a better user experience\n\nAlthough we haven\u2019t solved all our problems in this area, we\u2019ve made\ngreat progress with great results, and I look forward to sharing our\nbest policies and practices.\n",
