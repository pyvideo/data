  "description": "For most of the history of computing, we have focused on centralized forms of computing. It has always been faster and cheaper to do our processing with a powerful centralized processor than a group of lower-powered processors at the edges. This is changing. The last couple years have brought a new focus on scale-out and distributed architectures, but that is not enough. We are getting to the place where vastly more data, and vastly more compute power, will be available at the edges of our networks. How should this change how we approach the the future?",
