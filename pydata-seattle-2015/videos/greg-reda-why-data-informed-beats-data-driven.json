  "description": "Companies can't stop gushing about how \"data-driven\" they are - how they're using \"big data\" and \"data science\" to synergize and streamline all the things. But being driven by data alone is a flawed approach. Instead, companies should seek to be \"data-informed\" - interweaving designers, UXers, and data scientists so that each side is able to perfectly complement the one another.\n\nThis talk will discuss the importance of allowing data and user research to complement one another, in addition to the pitfalls of being driven by data alone (for instance, the cons of A/B testing).\n\nSlides available here: https://github.com/gjreda/pydata2015sea",
