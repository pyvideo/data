  "description": "The Pyramid FAQ\n\nPresented by Carlos de la Guardia\n\nThe #pylons IRC channel is the most common way of giving support to\nusers of the Pyramid framework. In this talk we take away some of the\nmost often discussed topics in the channel and give detailed answers to\nthem.\n\nAbstract\n\nEvery development project has a few questions and doubts that seem to\ncome up on its support channels every now and then. The Pyramid\nframework is no exception.\n\nIn this talk, we introduce Pyramid related FAQs using the chat logs and\nproceed to discuss them in detail. Showing the logs allows us to give\nthe talk a lighter side and makes for an introduction to each topic\nbased on real user questions.\n\nTopics covered here include:\n\n-  Configuration objects.\n-  Object traversal versus URL dispatch.\n-  Context and views.\n-  Authentication and authorization.\n-  How much 'Zope stuff' is there in Pyramid and can we take it away?\n-  Examples of how Pyramid enables the Pylons philosophy of integrating\n   best of breed or preferred components.\n-  The future of Pyramid and Pylons.\n\n",
