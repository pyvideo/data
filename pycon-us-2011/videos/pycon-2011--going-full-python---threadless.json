  "description": "Going Full Python -- Threadless\n\nPresented by Chris McAvoy\n\nThreadless is a 10 year old community based design company with an\noverpowering love of witty t-shirts and a mission to 'inspire\nawesomeness.' After 10 years of working primarily with PHP, Threadless\nhas decided to use Python as our base development language. The decision\nwas 10% technical and 90% touchy feely. We know what a powerful\ncommunity can do to a product, and see the same sort of drive and\npassion in the Python community that we see in our own design community.\nPython is the peanut butter to our jelly. We're excited to share our\njelly with you. Chris McAvoy, VP of Technology at Threadless (and the\nfounder of the Chicago Python Users Group), will share a bit about the\ncompanies history, the role of technology in supporting the community at\nthe core of the business, and why Python and Threadless are going to be\ntotally BFF's.\n",
