  "description": "Get new contributors (and diversity) through outreach\n\nPresented by Asheesh Laroia\n\nGroups like the Fedora Design Team, Dreamwidth, SF Ruby, and OpenHatch\nhave discovered the power of outreach to bring in new contributors. In\nthe past year, SF Ruby grew in numbers as well as in diversity, moving\nfrom 3% women to 18% women. Because most projects need ongoing help,\nthis talk discusses effective strategies for bringing in contributors\nwho stick around for the long haul.\n\nAbstract\n\nThis talk is targeted at anyone involved in an open source project who\nwants to find more contributors.\n\nPrograms like Google Summer of Code often provide excited students who\ndisappear after a summer's work. Meanwhile, request for help emails on\ndevelopment lists are typically met with silence. Hackathons create a\nflurry of commits, but then we never hear from the participants again.\nExpanding your team is possible, and it requires care in terms of\noutreach, expectation management, and mentorship.\n\nWe will discuss three major forms of outreach:\n\n-  One-on-one check-ins with participants,\n-  Periodic drives to bring in new contributors, and\n-  In-person teaching events. Each one has \"do\"s and \"don't\"s associated\n   with it. This talk digests the experience of effective outreach into\n   practical strategies that you can re-use within your project.\n\n",
