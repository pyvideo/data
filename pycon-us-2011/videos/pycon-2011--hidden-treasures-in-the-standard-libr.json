  "description": "Hidden Treasures in the Standard Library\n\nPresented by Doug Hellmann\n\nThis presentation covers features of the standard library not widely\nknown or used. Each feature is presented with a short demonstration\nprogram and explanation.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe standard library contains many hidden gems that are not widely used,\neither because they are not publicized enough or because they are deep\nin a module that programmers haven't had cause to study or use. This\npresentation covers 8-10 selected topics of this nature in about 25\nminutes (leaving time for a couple of questions). Demonstration code is\nincluded for every item.\n\nPossible tips include, in no particular order:\n\n-  Using hmac to verify pickled data before unpacking it.\n-  Using uuid4 to generate session tokens.\n-  Regular expression look-ahead/behind matches.\n-  pdb startup files\n-  Reading files with mmap\n-  Using csv dialects\n-  The robotparser module\n-  The rlcompleter module\n-  Using locale to format numbers and currency\n-  The cgitb module\n-  pkgutil.getdata\n-  contextlib.contextmanager\n-  The cmd module\n-  The fileinput module\n\n",
