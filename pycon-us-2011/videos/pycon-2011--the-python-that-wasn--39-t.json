  "description": "The Python That Wasn't\n\nPresented by Larry Hastings\n\nOne reason for Python's success is its restraint in adding new language\nfeatures. Only the most essential changes make it--and for every change\nthat gets accepted, many more are rejected. Come learn about proposed\nchanges to the Python language that failed--what, how, and why.\n\nAbstract\n\n-  Quick overview of the process\n\n   -  First ten years: send GvR a patch\n   -  The modern approach: python-ideas, write a PEP, produce a\n      reference implementation\n\n-  Discuss the \"prickly\" Python community\n\n   -  This is a good thing! Only the best ideas survive the python-dev\n      gauntlet!\n   -  They do this not because they're mean, but because they care so\n      much.\n   -  We must have eternal vigilance to prevent unnecessary changes!\n\n-  A survey of some changes that didn't make it\n\n   -  The switch/case statement (PEP 3103)\n   -  The \"freeze protocol\" (PEP 351)\n   -  The \"dynamic attribute access\" proposal from python-dev, 2007/02\n   -  Many more possibilities await in the rejected PEPs!\n\n-  My message to the audience\n\n   -  Start with a post to python-ideas, please!\n   -  Don't be surprised if you get a negative reaction\n   -  Don't let your fear of a negative reaction stop you from trying,\n      necessarily\n   -  Do your homework, and be your own worst critic\n\n\n",
