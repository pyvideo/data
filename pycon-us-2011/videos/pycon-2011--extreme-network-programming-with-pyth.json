  "description": "Extreme Network Programming with Python and Linux\n\nPresented by Rob Ludwick\n\nTraditionally, C is the preferred language for low level network\nprogramming and works well for those who have the time and patience to\nwork with it. As it turns out, Python is very capable for prototyping\nlow level network code, collecting data, and testing ideas quickly\nwithout getting lost in the land of C.\n\nAbstract\n\nWhile not as robust as C, Python provides a simple and elegant solution\nfor many cases to either prove a theory or gather data before developing\na more robust solution. Obscure topics such as raw sockets, multicast,\nnetwork bridging, rolling your own vpn, and disruption tolerant\nnetworking will be covered. Use of Python can enable building a custom\nprotocols, debugging a network, fixing broken nets, custom logging and\nprocessing, and simulation of networks. The author will talk about his\nexperiences using Python on Linux for extreme network programming and\npossibilities for future efforts.\n",
