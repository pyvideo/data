  "description": "Backup Is Hard; Let's Go Shopping\n\nPresented by Gary Bernhardt\n\nWe'll fly through the most clever bits of BitBacker, an online backup\napp developed as a startup for three years and eventually abandoned.\nHighlights: a hacked-up httplib/asyncore HTTP client; a real-life,\nHATEOAS-respecting RESTful API, and an encryption scheme that can\nquickly diff a file system against the server while leaking no\ninformation \u2013 not even file timestamps.\n\nAbstract\n\nThis is the story of a solution to a huge problem: fast, secure online\nbackup. A single client generates a hundred gigabytes, millions of data\nchunks, and thousands of file system snapshots. To appreciate the\nproblem's scale, consider that a Python array holding content hashes for\n1,000,000 files consumes 100 MB of memory. File hashes are only a\nportion of the required per- file metadata, and that's only one for\nsnapshot of thousands.\n\nWe'll tour the hard parts of this system with no apology for their\ndifficulty. The httplib/asyncore hybrid monster that served millions of\nparallel requests, transparently retrying on failures and timeouts, with\nonly 300 lines of python. The RESTful API \u2013 fully respecting hypertext,\nwith every request safely repeatable, even POSTs, and not a single\nhard-coded URL in the client. The encryption scheme that leaked nothing\n\u2013 not even modification times \u2013 but could quickly diff local file\nsystems against the server. And, that one time that a client\naccidentally requested a 4.76 megabyte URL in production.\n",
