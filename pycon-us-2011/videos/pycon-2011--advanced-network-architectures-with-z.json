Shaw\n\nIn this talk I will demonstrate how to use ZeroMQ with Python (and others) to\ndo really advanced or even weird network architectures. You'll see Python talk\nto other languages, handle HTTP, JSON, XML, WebSockets, encode videos, chat\nmessaging, etc. All in a short talk with only code, no diagrams. You should\nknow ZeroMQ already.\n\nAbstract\n\nThis talk will demonstrate a series of progressively difficult problems that\nyou can solve with ZeroMQ:\n\n  1. Basic messaging types (request/response, publish/subscribe). \n  2. Mongrel2 and HTTP processing. \n  3. Coroutine based web frameworks and why they suck (so quit making them). \n  4. Distributed worker queues of various flavors. \n  5. Asynchronous chat protocols with JSON and XML. \n  6. Clusters of calculators considering and communicating. \n  7. Talking to other languages and easily ditching Python if you need. \n  8. Anything else I can think up and do in a single screen of Python. \n\nThis talk will assume you know ZeroMQ and Python, but if you don't know ZeroMQ\nyou can probably still keep up.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/442_advanced-network-architectures-with-zeromq.mp4", "tags": ["mongrel", "pycon2011"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": 140780098, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2011AdvancedNetworkArchitecturesWithZeroMQ366.png", "video_flv_url": null}
