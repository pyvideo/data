  "description": "Statistical machine learning for text classification with scikit-learn\n\nPresented by Olivier Grisel\n\nThe goal of this talk is to give a state-of-the-art overview of machine\nlearning algorithms applied to text classification tasks ranging from\nlanguage and topic detection in tweets and web pages to sentiment\nanalysis in consumer products reviews.\n\nAbstract\n\nUnstructured or semi-structured text data is ubiquitous thanks to the\nread- write nature of the web. However human authors are often lazy and\ndon't fill- in structured metadata forms in web applications. It is\nhowever possible to automate some structured knowledge extraction with\nsimple and scalable statistical learning tools implemented in python.\nFor instance:\n\n-  guessing the language and topic of tweets and web pages\n-  analyze the sentiment (positive or negative) in consumer products\n   reviews in blogs or customer emails\n\nThis talk will introduce the main operational steps of supervised\nlearning:\n\n-  extracting the relevant features from text documents\n-  selecting the right machine learning algorithm to train a model for\n   the task at hand\n-  using the trained model on previously unseen documents\n-  evaluating the predictive accuracy of the trained model\n\nWe will also demonstrate the results obtained for above tasks using the\n`scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/>`__ package and\ncompare it to other implementations such as `nltk <http://nltk.org/>`__\nand the `Google Prediction\nAPI <http://code.google.com/apis/predict/>`__.\n",
