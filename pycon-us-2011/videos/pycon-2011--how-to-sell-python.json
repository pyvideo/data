Python is a great\ntool, but it can be challenging to get in the door. This panel will\nexplore how companies and individuals have successfully introduced\nPython, what tools are available to sell Python, and what pitfalls there\nare to avoid.\n\nPossible questions will include:\n\n-  What is a good example success story you can share?\n-  What pitfalls should you avoid?\n-  How do you deal with organizations that have already spent\n   bucketloads of money on a piss-poor technology stack, are hurting for\n   it, but can't seem to let go?\n-  How do you fight Fear-Uncertainty-Doubt (FUD) spread by people who\n   stand to lose from introducing Python?\n-  What tools are available to help sell Python?\n\nFive panelists will be chosen from a broad spectrum of individuals\nincluding academic, government, for-profit organizations, and non-profit\norganizations.\n\nSpeakers:\n\n-  Academia: C. Titus Brown\n-  Goverment: Chris Shenton of Koansys/NASA\n-  Large Commercial Organization: Dan Mesh of Evite\n-  Small Commercial Organization: Frank Wiles of RevSys\n-  Non-Profit Organization: Rich Leland of National Geographic\n\n",
