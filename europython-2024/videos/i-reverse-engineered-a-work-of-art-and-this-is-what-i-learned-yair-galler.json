  "description": "[EuroPython 2024 \u2014 Terrace 2B on 2024-07-10]\n\n\rI reverse engineered a work of art, and this is what I learned by Yair Galler\n\rhttps://ep2024.europython.eu/session/i-reverse-engineered-a-work-of-art-and-this-is-what-i-learned\n\n\rThis is the story of a weekend project which turned into a months long challenge. After coming across a photorealistic painting made entirely out of strings, I wanted to create one on my own. But how? I decided to reverse engineer the algorithm that computes which strings to stretch and in which order.\n\n\rIn this talk, I will show how I created a Python algorithm that produces a beautiful work of art. I will cover topics such as greedy algorithms, image processing, color spaces, performance optimization and many other challenges that I encountered while cracking the algorithm. And of course, I'll show the resulting work of art!\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
