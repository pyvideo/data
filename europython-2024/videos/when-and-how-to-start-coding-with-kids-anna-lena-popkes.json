For example, coding allows them to develop logical reasoning skills and teaches attention to detail. Allowing children to discover how much fun coding can be supports them in their development and opens many doors for their future.\n\n\rBut when and how should we start coding with kids? This talk will approach the question from a scientific perspective, looking into how children's brains develop, how children learn and how to best teach them coding abilities. It will answer important questions like \"At what age can a child start coding?\" or \"What are the benefits of learning to code?\". It will also present possible starting points, like learning platforms or tutorials.\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
