Is literally EVERYTHING an object? And what is an object anyway? Are objects the same as instances of a class? How do classes and types really work in Python? And what do metaclasses have to do with anything?\n\nIn fact, the answers to these questions are probably not what you think they are - Python's approach to objects is different from most other languages in sometimes surprising ways. \n\nThis talk will use simple live coded examples to explore how objects work in Python and clear up several common misconceptions and misunderstandings about how objects and instances, classes and types, and metaclasses all work together. \n\nBe warned - you are likely to be surprised when you learn the truth about objects in Python.\n\n---\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
