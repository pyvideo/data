  "description": "[EuroPython 2024 \u2014 North Hall on 2024-07-10]\n\n\rFrom Pandas to production: ELT with dlt by Violetta Mishechkina, Adrian Brudaru\n\rhttps://ep2024.europython.eu/session/from-pandas-to-production-elt-with-dlt\n\n\rWe created the \u201cdata load tool\u201d (dlt), an open-source Python library, to bridge the gap between data engineers and data scientists. In this talk you will learn about how dlt can help you overcome typical roadblocks in your data science workflows, and how it streamlines the transition from data exploration to production. We will also discuss the pains of maintaining data pipelines and how dlt can help you to avoid common engineering headaches. \n\n\rJoin us to learn best practices around data handling and managing failures with real-life examples!\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
