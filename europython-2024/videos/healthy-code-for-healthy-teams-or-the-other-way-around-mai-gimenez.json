  "description": "[EuroPython 2024 \u2014 Forum Hall on 2024-07-12]\n\n\rHealthy code for healthy teams (or the other way around) by Mai Gim\u00e9nez\n\rhttps://ep2024.europython.eu/session/healthy-code-for-healthy-teams-or-the-other-way-around\n\n\rCodebases often disappoint us, but we keep creating new ones with the absurd hope that it will be different this time. Spoiler alert: it never is.\n\n\rNotably, research codebases need to fulfil the oxymoron of being robust for long and large computations and highly flexible to experiment with outlandish ideas quickly.\n\n\rBut what if there was a way to break the cycle and build code that endures,\u00a0even for groundbreaking research.\n\n\rThis talk isn't about magic bullets or silver linings.\u00a0It's about the\u00a0powerful connection between healthy teams and healthy code. We'll explore how a healthy team improved the health of a codebase by introducing type annotations and runtime type checking for JAX arrays.\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
