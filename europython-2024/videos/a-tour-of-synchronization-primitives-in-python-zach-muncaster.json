  "description": "[EuroPython 2024 \u2014 North Hall on 2024-07-11]\n\n\rA Tour of Synchronization Primitives in Python by Zach Muncaster\n\rhttps://ep2024.europython.eu/session/a-tour-of-synchronization-primitives-in-python\n\n\rWhether using threads or task-based event loops, running code concurrently is not without its challenges. This talk takes a look at the features provided by the Python programming language to solve problems of synchronization when dealing with concurrently executing code.\n\n\rTogether we will take a look at the synchronization classes and functions provided by the Python threading and asyncio modules, what problems they aim to solve, and how we might use them effectively in our own code.\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
