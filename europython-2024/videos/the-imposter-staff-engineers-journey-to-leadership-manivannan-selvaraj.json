Imagine you're playing a video game where you're pretending to be a powerful leader, but deep down, you're convinced you're not really good enough. That's my daily life as a staff software engineer leading a team, except it's not a game, and the 'quit' button doesn't work. In this talk, I'll tell you about my hilarious misadventures and unexpected triumphs in the rollercoaster ride of being a staff software engineer and how my team still manages to create cool things despite my 'imposter' moments.\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
