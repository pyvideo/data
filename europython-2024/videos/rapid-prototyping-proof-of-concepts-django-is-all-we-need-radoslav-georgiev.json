  "description": "[EuroPython 2024 \u2014 Forum Hall on 2024-07-11]\n\n\rRapid Prototyping & Proof of Concepts: Django is all we need by Radoslav Georgiev\n\rhttps://ep2024.europython.eu/session/rapid-prototyping-proof-of-concepts-django-is-all-we-need\n\n\rIn this modern day and age, 2 things are for certain:\n\n\r1. Time-to-market for our products & features matters.\n\r2. We can easily drown in complexity and be carried away by over-engineering.\n\n\rHaving the ability to rapidly develop prototypes and proof of concepts is very powerful, because we can iterate towards the right thing, with code.\n\n\rWe know that we can use Django for building mature & long-lasting applications.\n\n\rBut what about building rapid prototypes and proof of concepts?\n\n\rIn this talk, we\u2019ll show that Django can do that job, reliably, as well.\n\n\rWe\u2019ll look at what Django & the rich 3rd party ecosystem has to offer us, when it comes to building rapid prototypes.\n\n\rWe\u2019ll focus on topics like:\n\n\r1. How to approach rapid prototyping with the correct mindset.\n\r2. Being quick with Django models.\n\r3. Realizing that types can be our friends.\n\r4. Realizing that Django admin may be all the UI we need (at least, in the beginning).\n\r5. Using HTMX where it makes sense.\n\r6. Components in Django templates are a good idea.\n\n\rThe talk will be practical & pragmatic, with the aim to provide good examples, derived from experience, that\u2019ll highlight the main topics and ideas.\n\n\rThe talk is great for both beginners, as well as seasoned Django developers.\n\n\rThe final goal is to give clear evidence, supported by examples, that we can use Django, reliably, to rapidly build prototypes & proof of concepts.\n\n\rIt turns out that Django is all we need.\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
