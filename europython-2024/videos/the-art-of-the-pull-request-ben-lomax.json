Want to get your work merged faster?*\n\n\rFor a lot of devs (especially newer ones) the important part of a PR is the code, not the structure of the PR. However, the way commits in a PR are put together to guide a reviewer can be massively impactful. This talk looks at how to effectively craft that review experience.\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
