  "description": "[EuroPython 2024 \u2014 South Hall 2B on 2024-07-12]\n\n\rAutomatic trusted publishing with PyPI by Facundo Tuesca\n\rhttps://ep2024.europython.eu/session/automatic-trusted-publishing-with-pypi\n\n\rPyPI added support for \u201cTrusted Publishing\u201d last year, allowing package maintainers to create releases directly from their GitHub Actions pipelines without having to worry about token management. Trusted Publishing removes long-lived API tokens from the equation, removing a threat vector for supply chain attacks.\n\rIn this talk, we\u2019ll go through the details of how this works, how maintainers can easily take advantage of it with minimal changes to their existing setup, and the ongoing effort in the last 12 months to add support for publishers other than GitHub, such as GitLab, Google, and ActiveState.\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
