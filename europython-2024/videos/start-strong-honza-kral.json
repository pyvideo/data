I just use `black`!\n\r* how do you set up your dev environment?\n\r* what version of `superFramework` are you running?\n\r* can you please update your PR, the tests don't pass.\n\n\rLet's put a stop to it! We will go through a collection of tools and techniques you can use to set up your new project for success. What to look for and how to make sure you can hit the ground running.\n\n\rCovered tools/techniques:\n\rLinting, testing, CI, dependency management, editor config, and some more...\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
