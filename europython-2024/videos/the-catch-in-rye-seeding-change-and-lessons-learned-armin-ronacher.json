Rye is in many ways just another way to try to fix Python packaging, but it's also happy to not exist if something takes its place. This talk goes over all the lessons learned from writing it, what has lead to it's creation, how it's built internally and what we can do to just solve the problem once and for all.\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
