Annotations have become synonymous with typing information, even though they could be just about anything you\u2019d want. Are there use cases for function annotations other than typing? Is that useful? Should you care? Should you stop using typing?\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
