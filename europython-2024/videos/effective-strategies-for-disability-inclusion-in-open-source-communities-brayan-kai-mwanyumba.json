This talk will delve into practical measures such as referral programs, internal disability disclosures, and integrating disability into existing agendas rather than treating it as a separate issue. We will dive into disability mainstreaming with a focus on its role in promoting universal design and inclusivity. Attendees will gain insights into establishing disability mainstreaming committees, formulating action plans, implementing best practices, and monitoring and evaluating progress.\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
