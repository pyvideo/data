This talk will show how a project that aims to teach Python using poems and that grew hand in hand with the Python community has been changing the lives of children and, currently, teachers in a country in the global south. In order to demonstrate it, I will teach you how to create function blocks, conditional and looping structures in an easy and empowering way, while discussing topics such as racism, xenophobia, homophobia, and sexism, for example, through Python code integrated with poetry.\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
