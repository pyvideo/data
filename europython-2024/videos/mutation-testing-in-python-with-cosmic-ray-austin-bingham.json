  "description": "[EuroPython 2024 \u2014 South Hall 2A on 2024-07-11]\n\n\rMutation Testing in Python with Cosmic Ray by Austin Bingham\n\rhttps://ep2024.europython.eu/session/mutation-testing-in-python-with-cosmic-ray\n\n\rMutation testing is a technique for systematically mutating source code in order to validate test suites. It operates by making small changes to a program\u2019s source code and then running a test suite; if the test suite ever succeeds on mutated code then a flag is raised. The goal is to check that a system\u2019s test suite is sufficiently powerful to detect a large class of functionality-affecting changes, thereby helping ensure that the system functions as expected. While not in widespread use, mutation testing is a fascinating topic with great potential that has valuable lessons for the broader software development community.\n\n\rIn this talk we\u2019ll look at Cosmic Ray, an open-source mutation testing tool for Python. Mutation testing presents some difficult and fascinating challenges - both conceptually and from an implementation point of view - so we\u2019ll look at how Cosmic Ray addresses (or plans to address) these complexities. While some of these details will necessarily be Python-specific, there are lessons in Cosmic Ray for the development of mutation in any language.\n\n\rMutation testing is still a rather exotic testing technique, but it can produce genuinely useful and surprising results. To show this, we\u2019ll look at a number of cases where Cosmic Ray has helped developers improve their test suites and tighten up their implementations.\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
