New ideas require new people, a new background and lots of energy.\n\n\rThis panel aims for the people to be aware of the changes that are coming in 3.13, and future versions, as well as ways people can contribute by testing features, fixing issues, or even sharing their own ideas.\n\n\rHost: Konstantin Ignatov\n\rPanelists: Pablo Galindo Salgado, \u0141ukasz Langa,  Carol Willing, Hugo van Kemenade, Victor Stinner and Petr Viktorin\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
