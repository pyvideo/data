Introducing a few off-the-shelves options like ipython % magics, and cachetools.\n\rShowcasing how one would build their own mini-caching framework, that fits for their specific use case, using pandas and spark for the example\n\rExplaining when to stop trying to cache, and keeping the caching framework mini, what are the signs that caching went overboard.\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
