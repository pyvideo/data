This keynote will highlight the powerful combination of Python, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and heuristics for enabling dynamic decision-making processes.\n\n\rWe will explore the strengths of Python as a versatile language, the potential of AI for intelligent decision support, and the value of heuristics derived from real-world experience. By embracing this synergistic trio, developers can navigate complex challenges, adapt to changing requirements, and make decisions that drive successful software outcomes.\n\n\rThrough practical examples and insights, attendees will gain a deeper understanding of how to leverage Python, AI, and heuristics effectively, striking the right balance between technological innovation and tried-and-true techniques. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting your journey, this keynote will equip you with the tools and mindset to embrace agility and make informed decisions that propel your software projects forward.\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
