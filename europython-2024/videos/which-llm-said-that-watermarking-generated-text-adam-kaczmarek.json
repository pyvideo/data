This raises many concerns regarding eg. social engineering, fake news generation and cheating in many educational assignments. While there are several black-box methods for detecting if text was written by human or LLM they have significant issues. \n\n\rI will discuss how by watermarking you can equip your LLM with a mechanism that undetectable to human eye can give you the means of verifying if it was the true source of a generated text.\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
