In this presentation, we will explore how you can leverage the power of Visual Studio Code, GitHub, and Azure to develop, test, and deploy generative AI applications. We will discuss the latest tools and techniques for building and training generative models, and demonstrate how to build a sample application using GPT-4o, VS Code and its extensions. Additionally, we will showcase how to use GitHub for version control and collaboration, and how to deploy and manage your applications using Azure. For both beginners and veterans, join us to learn how you can master the power of generative AI to create innovative applications.\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
