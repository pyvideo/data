You\u2019ll go through a captivating exploration of insights, intuitive reasoning, solid mathematical underpinnings, and a treasure trove of interesting examples!\n\n\rWe'll kick off by surveying the landscape, from ensemble models to stacked estimators, gradually ascending towards the pinnacle of MoE. Along the way, we'll explore challenges, alternative routes, and the crucial art of knowing when to wield the MoE magic\u2014AND when to hold back. Brace yourselves for a business-oriented finale, where we discuss metrics around cost, latency, and throughput for MoE models. And fear not! We'll wrap up with an array of resources equipping you to dive headfirst into pre-trained MoE models, fine-tune them, or even forge your own from scratch. May the force of Experts be with you !\"\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
