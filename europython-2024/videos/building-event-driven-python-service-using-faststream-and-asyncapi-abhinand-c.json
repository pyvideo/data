Through practical examples and insights, you'll discover the art of building scalable, responsive Python applications that thrive in real-time environments.\n\n\n\r#### About AsyncAPI\n\rAsyncAPI is an open standard/specification and growing set of open-source tools to help developers define, build, and maintain asynchronous APIs and Event-Driven Architectures. It describes message-driven APIs in a machine-readable format, and is protocol-agnostic.\n\n\r#### About FastStream\n\rFastStream is a powerful and easy-to-use Python framework for building asynchronous services interacting with event streams such as Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS and Redis. FastStream simplifies the process of writing producers and consumers for message queues, handling all the parsing, networking and documentation generation automatically. FastStream provides unified API across multiple brokers, built-in Pydantic validations, automatic AsyncAPI documentation, FastAPI like Dependency Injection System, built-in support for test and extensions.\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
