But the hidden monster will be unleashed when we try to run non-thread safe code in a multithreaded setup. \n\n\rWe will discuss the problems which can happen when seemingly good code is run in a multithreaded environment. We will walk over the concept of race coditions, how Python\u2019s GIL currently affects multithreading and will cover steps to fix thread unsafe code using synchronization primitives.\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
