This talk ventures into the depths of the Python standard library to unearth lesser-known features from itertools, collections, functools, typing and more.\n\n\rAll of these tools are already built into every standard python installation and no \"(uv) pip install\" is necessary.\n\n\rMany if not all of those are likely already known to old fashioned pythonistas, but for beginners (1-2years) there will be something new to learn, while for intermediate python developers there might be at least a few more gems to discover.\n\n\rBy delving into these underutilized modules, attendees will gain a richer understanding of Python's built-in capabilities and learn how to write more pythonic code.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n05:30 Chapter 1: Fetching data\n05:42 urllib\n06:48 TypedDict\n09:02 Batching\n09:44 islice\n11:10 batched\n11:50 DictWriter\n15:32 Chapter 2: Cleaning data\n17:22 pairwise\n19:16 chain\n22:20 ChainMap\u00b9\n23:36 Multiple Context Managers\n25:54 Doctest\n27:44 yield from\n29:44 misusing return value in generators\n33:03 NamedTuple\u00b2\n33:06 Chapter 3: Processing data\n34:51 defaultdict\n36:28 Counter\n39:55 groupby\n43:10 reduce / tee\n\nCorrections\n22:21 \u00b9itertools.ChainMap is wrong: collections.ChainMap is right\n33:06 \u00b2We also need to yield one more time at the end for the case, where the last books are lost books. Maybe even yield namedtuple(book: Book, lost: bool)\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
