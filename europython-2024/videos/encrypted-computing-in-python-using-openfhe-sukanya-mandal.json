  "description": "[EuroPython 2024 \u2014 North Hall on 2024-07-12]\n\n\r\u200b\u200bEncrypted computing in Python using OpenFHE by Sukanya Mandal\n\rhttps://ep2024.europython.eu/session/encrypted-computing-in-python-using-openfhe\n\n\rFully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a privacy-enhancing technology that enables performing computations over encrypted data. FHE has recently seen a lot of progress, and commercial applications of FHE are now available. One of the main application domains for FHE is privacy-preserving machine learning. We introduce a Python interface for OpenFHE, a popular open-source FHE C++ software library that supports all common FHE schemes. OpenFHE is a NumFocus-sponsored open-source project that has been authored by a community of well-known FHE cryptographers and software engineers.The talk provides a high-level introduction to FHE and its applications, and then provides an overview of the Python API. Several examples are presented to both illustrate FHE concepts and show the practicality of the technology.\n\n\rMore information about the OpenFHE project: \n\r* Main website: https://www.openfhe.org/ ;\n\r* OpenFHE discourse forum: https://openfhe.discourse.group/ ;\n\r* Main OpenFHE repository: https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development ;\n\r* OpenFHE organization: https://github.com/openfheorg ;\n\r* Main OpenFHE design paper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/915 ;\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
