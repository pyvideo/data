Fortunately, we have FFMpeg - a \"complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video\". It is a great tool, but its CLI is quite complex and challenging to master unless you use it on a daily basis. During this talk, I will tell you what FFmpeg is and how to use it in Python without hurting yourself.\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
