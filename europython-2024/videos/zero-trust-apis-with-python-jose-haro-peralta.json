  "description": "[EuroPython 2024 \u2014 South Hall 2A on 2024-07-10]\n\n\rZero Trust APIs with Python by Jose Haro Peralta\n\rhttps://ep2024.europython.eu/session/zero-trust-apis-with-python\n\n\rWhat does it take to deliver a properly secured API? When we think about API security, we first think of authentication and authorization. But there\u2019s more to it. API security also includes protecting against SQL Injection attacks, Mass Assignment, Excessive Data Exposure, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRS), and more.\n\n\rAPIs are now the main attack vector on the Internet, and we gotta do something about it. Thankfully, Python boasts excellent libraries for API development, like FastAPI, the Django REST Framework, APIFlask, and more. When used properly, these libraries help us deliver secure APIs.\n\n\rIn this talk, I\u2019ll present a model of Zero Trust Security for APIs that applies robust data validation and sanitization across all data flows to help us deliver secure APIs. You\u2019ll learn how your API design and implementation choices impact API security and how to discover and tackle vulnerabilities.\n\n\rWe\u2019ll walk through practical examples of SQL injection, mass assignment, big payload attacks, pagination attacks, and more. We\u2019ll see how URL parameters and request payloads can become attack vectors when they\u2019re not properly configured.\n\n\rYou\u2019ll also learn how to use tools like schemathesis and Spectral to automate and scale the process of detecting vulnerabilities in your APIs.\n\n\rBy the end of this talk, you\u2019ll be aware of the most important threats to our APIs and you\u2019ll know how to discover and address them effectively. You\u2019ll also get familiar with the concepts of API Security by Design, Shift-Left API Security, and Zero Trust APIs.\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
