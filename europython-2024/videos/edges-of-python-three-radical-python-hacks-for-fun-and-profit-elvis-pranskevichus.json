In this\n\rtalk you learn some of the unusual Python tricks that we use at EdgeDB\n\rto write more efficient Python with fewer bugs, and which you can apply in\n\ryour project next time you need to scratch a similar itch.\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
