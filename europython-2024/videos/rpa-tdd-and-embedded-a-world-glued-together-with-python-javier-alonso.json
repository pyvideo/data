Or _TDD?_ Or \"embedded\"? At least, for sure, you know what *Python* is \ud83d\ude09.\n\n\r\"RPA\" stands for \"Robotic Process Automation\", whereas \"TDD\" stands for \"Test Driven Development\". Those words usually refer to either the testing process or the automation of it. In the embedded world - the microcontroller one - it is usually easy to test features unitarily, but *hard to test them working within a bigger system.*\n\n\rTherefore... What is this everything about? In this talk [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) is introduced as the tool to integrate almost everything! Firstly, [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) is introduced: Explain its purpose, semantics, basic writing, etc. Then, we will dig a little into it and how to maximize its potential by tweaking the internal libraries and writing our own ones. Next, we will simulate a real embedded device which we require some integration testing: Exchange some messages, evaluate an external request, etc. And finally, we will glue all this together with [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/)!\n\n\rSounds interesting, right? Jump into this initialization talk for you to get introduced - or acquire more knowledge - into the embedded and testing world.\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
