Among the many new features, several changes to both the Python API and the C API, and a great deal of documentation improvements, there was also a lot of work on improving the performance of string operations.\n\n\rIn this talk, we'll go through the timeline of the changes and the resulting performance improvements, while also diving deep into NumPy ufunc internals and explaining topics like NumPy (parametric) dtypes, type promotion and more.\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
