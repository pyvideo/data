Wouldn\u2019t loading and starting tracking in nearly zero time be nice? What if we could track more and faster, even handling arbitrarily large, complex Python objects with ease?\n\n\rIn this talk, I will present the results of comparative benchmarks covering Weights & Biases, MLflow, FastTrackML, Neptune, Aim, Comet, and MLtraq. You will learn their strengths and weaknesses, what makes them slow and fast, and what sets MLtraq apart, making it 100x faster and capable of handling tens of thousands of experiments.\n\n\rThis presentation will not only be enlightening for those involved in AI/ML experimentation but will also be invaluable for anyone interested in the efficient and safe serialization of Python objects.\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
