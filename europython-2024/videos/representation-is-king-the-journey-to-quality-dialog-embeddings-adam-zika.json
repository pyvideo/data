  "description": "[EuroPython 2024 \u2014 Terrace 2A on 2024-07-12]\n\n\rRepresentation is King: The Journey to Quality Dialog Embeddings by Adam Z\u00edka\n\rhttps://ep2024.europython.eu/session/representation-is-king-the-journey-to-quality-dialog-embeddings\n\n\rIn natural language processing, embeddings are crucial for understanding textual data. In this talk, we\u2019ll explore sentence embeddings and their application in dialog systems. We'll focus on a use case involving the classification of dialogs.\n\n\rWe'll demonstrate the necessity of sentence transformers for this problem, specifically utilizing one of the top-performing small-sized sentence transformers. We will show how to fine-tune this model with both labeled and unlabeled dialog data, using the SentenceTransformers Python framework.\n\n\rThis talk is practical, packed with easy-to-follow examples, and aimed at building intuition around this topic. While some basic knowledge of Transformers would be beneficial, it is not required. Newcomers are also welcome.\n\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
