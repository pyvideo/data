  "description": "[EuroPython 2024 \u2014 Terrace 2A on 2024-07-11]\n\n\rNLP Application in Cases of Violence Against Women by Deborah Foroni\n\rhttps://ep2024.europython.eu/session/nlp-application-in-cases-of-violence-against-women\n\n\rDomestic violence is a widespread problem, one which demands attention and policy fixes. But available data is largely unstructured, making analysis difficult for both researchers and policy makers. In this talk, I'll show you how Python helped me to retrieve, structure, and classify violence victims' testimony. I'll show which APIs and libraries allowed me to retrieve the woman's testimony from YouTube, turn their speech into text, and then analyze the text itself. You'll come away knowing not just some new Python techniques, but also how those techniques can be used to improve our society.\n\n\r---\n\rThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
