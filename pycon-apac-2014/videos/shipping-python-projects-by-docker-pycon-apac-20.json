  "description": "Docker is an open source project to easily create lightweight, portable,\nself-sufficient containers from any application. We can easily build the\ncontainer in our own laptop and then run this container at scale.\nThere're two parts in my presentation. I'll give a brief introduction\nfirst. Then I'll build a image for a simple python website by flask (or\nDjango), and deploy it to my own computer, virtualbox, aws ec2, and\ngoogle cloud engine.\n",
