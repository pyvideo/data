  "description": "We all start our programming with single process in mind. But\nparallelization from scratch is a real headache. Things get worse when\nit comes to writing a spaghetti code in both short time and high\nperformance, which is often the case doing data analysis.\n\nIn fact, cases like computation under different conditions, programs can\nbe easily parallelized (distributed) with a few modifications using\nexisted library like multiprocessing, IPython Parallel, and Celery.\n\nThis talk makes you not afraid of parallel or distributed computing and\nprovides ways for different level of parallelization from single\nmachine, cluster, to cluster with task queue. I will only talk about the\nbasic scenario, which should be easier for newbies to try on and\nunderstand how powerful these tools can be.\n\nA machine learning example will be given in the end to compare\nperformance and possible issues with different implementations.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\n\u5446\u5446\u96fb\u96de\u751f\uff0c\u559c\u6b61\u5beb R / Python\uff0c\u559c\u6b61\u7d71\u8a08\u8207\u751f\u7269\u8cc7\u8a0a\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u70ba Taiwan R Users\nGroup \u5de5\u4f5c\u4eba\u54e1\u53ca Taipei.py \u5e38\u5ba2\u3002\n\nBioinfo / Stat / R / Python, master student of NTU BEBI.
