Mezzanine is one project that aims to simplify these\nquestions with a compelling offering for developing Python powered\nwebsites.\n\nIn this talk, Stephen McDonald the creator of Mezzanine will walk\nthrough the history of Mezzanine, covering the constraints that have\ndictated its design, its approach to providing simple yet flexible,\nrapid web development, through to the software eco-system and community\nthat have developed around it.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nStephen McDonald is a software engineer who has worked in the web\ndevelopment space since the late 90s, when Netscape Gold and ICQ reigned\nsupreme.\n\nCurrently Stephen works with several startups using Python and Django.\nBy day he's the technical lead at Mathspace, applying machine learning\ntechniques to transform maths education. By night he works on scaling\nthe news reader Kouio, to handle hundreds of millions of news articles\nfrom around the world.\n\nSomewhere in between these, Stephen is also the creator and maintainer\nof Mezzanine, one of the most popular CMS projects for the Django\nframework.\n",
