  "description": "Although there are several data mining tools in python, you can use them\nto deal with almost every kind of data (numeric, text, image, audio,\n...) you met. Besides, there are also lots of modeling tools in python,\nyou can use them to build the FIRST LIGHTING MODEL to solve the\nproblems.\n\nHowever, if you want to solve problems deeply, most of time, you need to\nwrite down the customerized models and solve them by yourself. Instead\nof using fast modeling tools, you need to know more about the essential\nthings in modeling:\n\n-  What is a model ?\n-  How models solve your problems ?\n-  What is the connection between models and data ?\n-  What is the important data ? important model ?\n\nI deeply believe ... The more the connection between models and data you\nknow, the deeper the problem you can solve.\n\n| Outline: What is Modeling ?\n| Data, Model, Evaluators\n| Direct Problem: Data + Evaluators \u2192 Model\n| Inverse Problem: Data + Models \u2192 Evaluator\n| Hacking Models with Metric Learning\n| Data as a Model & Model as a Data\n| Duality between Dimension Reduction and Clustering\n",
