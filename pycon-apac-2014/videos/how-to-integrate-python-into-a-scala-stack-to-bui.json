  "description": "Fliptop's primary business used to be contact record linkage. We\nbuilt-out some substantial infrastructure, coding primarily in Scala,\nand using JVM-stack libraries. In the past year, we've moved beyond our\ndata business into building predictive analytics applications for Sales\nand Marketing teams, so it was necessary to build a data science/machine\nlearning stack. While there's plenty of machine-learning tools for the\nJVM, we felt that the Python ecosystem had many advantages for our\nuse-case (which we'll discuss), and we think we integrated them in a\nclever way.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nI'm a data scientist and software engineer. Languages of choice are\nScala and Python. I have been working with AWS for production for over\nthree years. My interest is in building data analytics applications with\ncloud computing technologies.\n",
