  "description": "As we work in open data science spaces, we frequently peer-teach coding and collaboration skills. The setup work is often grossly underestimated and unseen. I\u2019ll share how Openscapes automates setup with the Kyber R package that uses googlesheets4 and creates RMarkdown documents that become collaborative Google Doc agendas, and sets up repositories and organizes people on GitHub. Kyber replaces manual steps with R functions while maintaining the ability to edit outputs so we\u2019re not constrained by the automation. It has enabled us to teach workshops repeatedly in less time \u2013 in 2022, we led four concurrent learning cohorts with 160 government scientists! Kyber is openly available to fork, reuse, and extend, and other groups are doing just that.\n\nTalk by Stefanie Butland\n\n\nSlides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p_EXdYEVGY07VVMGdcvvwjjbwFihHsC_5oXRPW_8tVU/\nKyber GitHub Repo: https://github.com/openscapes/kyber\nOpenscapes: https://openscapes.org/",
