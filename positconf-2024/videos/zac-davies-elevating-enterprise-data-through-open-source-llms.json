  "description": "In an era where data privacy and security are paramount, many organizations are keen on leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) in conjunction with their proprietary data without exposing it to third-party services. Recognizing this need, our talk, \"Elevating Enterprise Data Through Open Source LLMs,\" showcases an approach that integrates the capabilities of Databricks and Posit, enabling businesses to maintain ownership and control over their data and LLMs while delivering value to their customers. The core of our discussion revolves around a system architecture that synergizes the strengths of Databricks and Posit technologies, providing a comprehensive solution for enterprise data and open-source LLMs. Databricks is responsible for data management and processing, offering a seamless environment for hosting, serving, and fine-tuning open-source LLMs. Keeping data and models in the secure perimeter of Databricks lowers the risk of data exfiltration tremendously, and also benefits from the scalable data processing and machine learning capabilities - including the recent acquisition MosaicML - that Databricks delivers. Posit steps in to streamline the process through Posit Workbench, the developer platform for data science with custom integrations for working with Databricks. This allows developers to write, test, and refine their code in a familiar and powerful setting while still being able to access the data, compute, and model serving offered by Databricks. In addition, Posit Connect offers an easy-to-use platform for deploying these applications, ensuring that the end-to-end process, from development to deployment, is efficient, secure, and aligned with enterprise standards. \n\nAttendees of this talk will gain valuable insights into constructing and deploying LLM-powered applications using their enterprise data. By the end of the session, you will have a clear understanding of how to leverage Databricks for optimal data management and LLM operations, alongside Posit's streamlined development and deployment processes. This knowledge will empower you to deliver secure, effective, and scalable LLM-powered applications, driving innovation and value from your enterprise data while upholding the highest standards of data privacy and security.\n\nTalk by Zac Davies\n\n\nSlides: https://github.com/zacdav-db/presentations",
