  "description": "In my work I am often asked to develop interactive data explorers for public-use data sets, with an emphasis on making the tools engaging, easy to use, and understandable for a general audience. I\u2019d like to talk about the work my team does to develop user-friendly Shiny applications that look and feel like full websites and share some of the tools we use. This includes things like designing landing pages, creating detailed \u201cAbout\u201d pages, letting users share links to specific charts or download static versions, adding social media sharing links, site meta tags, sub-URLs, and so much more. After attending this talk, I hope others are excited about leveraging tools to make their users say \u201cWait, that\u2019s Shiny?\u201d\n\nTalk by Kiegan Rice\n\nFull title: Wait, that\u2019s Shiny?
