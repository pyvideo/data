  "description": "These days, you can’t turn around without encountering a large language model—they’re embedded in everything from Google search results to the lower-right corner of every Windows desktop. \n\nBut… in your Shiny app? \n\nIn this talk, we’ll discuss some ways the Shiny team is combining the magical chaos of LLMs with the structure and control of Shiny. You’ll learn how to use modern chat models to add features to your Shiny apps that will feel like science fiction to your users while minimizing the risks of hallucination, irreproducibility, and data exposure.",
