  "description": "Tables are great, and we\u2019ve been doing a lot on both the R and Python sides to make it possible to generate aesthetically pleasing tables. The gt package for R has been under continuous development for six years, and there are still so many things we can do to make it better. Great Tables, our new Python package, brings beautiful tables to Python users and provides an API that\u2019s in tune with that ecosystem. \n\nWhile we have made great strides and unlocked new table-making possibilities for our users, our ambitions are huge! So, we\u2019d like to show you the state of things on this front and also where we intend to go with our collective table efforts.\n\nTalk by Richard Iannone\n\n\nSlides: https://github.com/rich-iannone/presentations/blob/main/2024-08-13-posit_conf_adequate_tables/gt_GT_talk_posit_conf.pdf\nGitHub Repo: https://github.com/rich-iannone/presentations/tree/main/2024-08-13-posit_conf_adequate_tables",
