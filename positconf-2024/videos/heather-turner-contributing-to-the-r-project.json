  "description": "Posit provides an amazing set of products to support data science, and we will learn about many great packages and approaches from both Posit and the wider community at posit::conf(2024). But underlying it all are a number of open source tools, notably R and Python. How can we contribute to sustaining these open source projects, so that we can continue to use and build on them? \n\nIn this talk I will address this question in the context of the R project. I will give an overview of the ways we can contribute as individuals or companies/organizations, both financially and in kind. Together we can build a more sustainable future for R!\n\nTalk by Heather Turner\n\n\nSlides: https://hturner.github.io/positconf2024/\nR Contributor Site: https://contributor.r-project.org/",
