  "description": "In the world of crochet, the Woobles kit simplifies yarn, hooks, and stitches for beginners, alleviating decision fatigue and fostering early success. This model unexpectedly extends to the domain of R. Newcomers, especially in industries less familiar with open-source, may find mastering new tools daunting. We grappled with this while developing {tfrmt}, a table-making package for pharma. This talk will draw parallels with crochet to explore strategies for engaging and retaining new users. Attendees will grasp the role of a starter kit for easing the learning curve and the value of nurturing experts with transferable skills. They'll glean insights to support their own audiences, whether in creating an R package or crafting a cuddly unicorn.\n\nTalk by Becca Krouse",
