  "description": "Creating engaging data content has never been easier, yet easily sharing remains a challenge. And that's the point, right? You cleaned the data, wrangled it, and summarized everything for others to benefit. But where do you put that final result? If you're still using R Markdown, perhaps it's rpubs.com. If you've adopted Quarto, it could be quartopub.com. Have a Jupyter notebook? Well, that's a different service. And this is just for docs. Want to deploy a streamlit app? Head to streamlit.io. Shiny? Log into shinyapps.io. Dash? You could use ploomber.io, if you have a docker file - and know what that is. This session summarizes the landscape for online data sharing and describes a new tool that Posit is working on to simplify your process.",
