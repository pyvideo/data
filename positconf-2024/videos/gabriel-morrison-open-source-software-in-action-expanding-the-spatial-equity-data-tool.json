  "description": "The Urban Institute\u2019s Spatial Equity Data Tool enables users to upload their own data and quickly assess whether place-based programs and resources\u2014such as libraries or Wi-Fi hotspots\u2014are equitably distributed across neighborhoods and demographic groups. Our (forthcoming) API and R package also enable users to seamlessly incorporate equity analytics into existing workflows and exciting new tools. \n\nIn this talk, I will share how we've expanded access to the tool using multi-language software. I'll discuss our updates to Python-based tool and API; R package wrapping the API; and Quarto-based documentation. I will also share how our partners in the City of Los Angeles have used the API and RShiny to build a custom budget equity tool.\n\nTalk by Gabriel Morrison\n\n\nSlides: https://urbanorg.box.com/s/vecuwuwhtj1zkha09nznq9p0qxdttl9r\nGitHub Repo: https://github.com/UrbanInstitute/ui-equity-tool",
