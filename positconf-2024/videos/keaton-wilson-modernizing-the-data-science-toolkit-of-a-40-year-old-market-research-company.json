  "description": "This presentation outlines the efforts undertaken by the Decision Sciences and Innovation (DSI; which focuses on statistical consulting and end-to-end quantitative analysis) team at KS&R to modernize their data science toolkit over the past year. The main goals were to foster collaboration, improve our legacy codebase, and deliver high-quality data products. Key topics covered include teamwide adoption of version control and GitHub, building and deploying internal R packages, Quarto-based documentation, and strategies for gaining buy-in across teams and leadership. Attendees can expect practical insights and tools for instigating change in their own organizations.\n\nTalk by Keaton Wilson",
