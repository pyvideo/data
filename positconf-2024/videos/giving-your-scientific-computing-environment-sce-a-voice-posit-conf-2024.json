  "description": "Full Title: Giving your scientific computing environment (SCE) a voice: experiences and learnings leveraging operational data from our SCE and Posit products to help us serve our users better\n\nPlatform owners often ask questions like \u2018how quickly do users migrate to new versions of R\u2019, \u2018what programming languages are used\u2019, and \u2018how are internal packages, dashboards and outputs consumed\u2019? \n\nThe answer to these questions and many more lives within the operational logs collected by systems like Posit Connect, Github, and AWS. I\u2019ll share examples of how we use this data at Roche to shape our product roadmap. I\u2019ll also share some ideas we are exploring to use this data to help empower our data scientists to understand the hidden consequence of how they work through feeding back personal cost and environmental impact - enabling informed decisions, e.g., what it means to schedule a pin to update daily, or request 2 vs 8 cores.\n\nTalk by James Black",
