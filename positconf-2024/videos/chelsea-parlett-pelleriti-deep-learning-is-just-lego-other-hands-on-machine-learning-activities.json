  "description": "Machine Learning involves a lot of math, and a lot of code. But it can also involve LEGO, coloring sheets, and 3D-printed gradients! Hands-on, kinesthetic activities help people learn complex technical concepts in an intuitive way, and, to be honest, provide a welcome break from all the formulas and function definitions. These activities not only increase engagement but make the topic more accessible to a wider range of people. Come learn how to use and design these activities for yourself, or for a class!\n\nTalk by Chelsea Parlett-Pelleriti",
