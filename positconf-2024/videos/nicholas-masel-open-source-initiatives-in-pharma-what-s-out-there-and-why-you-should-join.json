  "description": "The pharmaceutical industry has come a long way when it comes to using open-source and collaborating on initiatives to solve complex industry issues. The number of initiatives and working groups that are now available have grown so much over the last 5 to 10 years that understanding what to join, or even just what to keep track of, can feel like selecting an R package, you\u2019ve got a lot of options! This is a good problem to have, but it can also feel like a barrier to entry for companies or individuals in the industry who are looking to learn and/or contribute. In this talk, I will present guidance to the pharmaceutical industry to help them navigate the open-source collaboration landscape to help companies and individuals get involved.\n\nTalk by Nicholas Masel\n\n\nSlides: https://nicholas-masel.github.io/posit2024/2024_posit_conf.html\nGitHub Repo: https://nicholas-masel.github.io/posit2024_supplemental/Supplemental%20Material.html",
