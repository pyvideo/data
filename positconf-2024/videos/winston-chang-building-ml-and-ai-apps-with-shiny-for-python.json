  "description": "In the last few months, the best LLMs have taken a big step forward in their ability to help write code. We\u2019ve been building a tool that uses an LLM to help you learn Shiny and build Shiny applications much faster than ever before. \n\nIf you feel like you don\u2019t have the time to invest in learning Shiny, this might change your mind. You\u2019ll get up and running with Shiny in no time, and you\u2019ll be able to learn from the AI as you go. If you already know Shiny, you\u2019ll be able to dramatically accelerate your development process, and you\u2019ll find yourself trying out new things that wouldn\u2019t have been worth the effort before.\n\nTalk by Winston Chang",
