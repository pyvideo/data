  "description": "This talk is geared towards those who may feel comfortable working independently with Git but need some confidence when working collaboratively. Just like novice drivers can learn to confidently (and safely!) merge onto (seemingly) intimidating highways, those new to collaborating with Git can also conquer Git merges with some exposure and preparation. \n\nThis talk will go over: \n\n- Different ways R users can interact with Git - What Git merges and Git merge conflicts are - Real-life examples of Git merges - Advice on resolving Git merges - Suggestions for cleaner workflows to promote better Git merges",
