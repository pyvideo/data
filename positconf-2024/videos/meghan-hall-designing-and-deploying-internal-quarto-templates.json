  "description": "Quarto is a game-changer for creating reproducible, parameterized documents. But the beauty of Quarto—that it has so many different use cases with various output formats—can lead to disarray with numerous .qmd files floating around an organization and too much copy-paste when creating something new. Quarto templates are perfect for easing the burden of developing a report and instead standardizing the structure, style, and initial content of your projects, no matter the output format. We’ll discuss tips and tricks for implementing enough HTML and CSS to create beautiful documents that match your organization’s branding and also explore how easy it can be to deploy those Quarto templates with a single function within an internal R package.",
