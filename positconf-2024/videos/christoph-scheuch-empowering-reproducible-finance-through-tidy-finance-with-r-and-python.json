  "description": "Tidy Finance merges cutting-edge research in financial economics with the principles of transparency and reproducibility, providing a novel, open-source toolkit available in both R and Python. This multi-language approach simplifies financial data analysis while teaching best practices for reproducible research, integrating narrative with clean, easy-to-read code and replicable results. By promoting transparent code, public sharing, and multi-language support, Tidy Finance equips researchers, educators, and students with critical tools that foster a more reproducible academic environment. This talk will explore the development and impact of Tidy Finance, offering inspiration for attendees from various fields to advance open-source and reproducibility in their own work.\n\nTalk by Christoph Scheuch\n\n\nSlides: https://talks.tidy-finance.org/\nGitHub Repo: https://github.com/tidy-finance/website",
