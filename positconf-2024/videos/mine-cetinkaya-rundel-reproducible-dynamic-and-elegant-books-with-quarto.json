  "description": "Building on my experience writing books with Quarto for various audiences (R learners, statistics learners, and Quarto learners), for various venues (self-published and publisher-published), in various formats (HTML books hosted online and PDF books printed), I will share best practices and tips and tricks for authoring reproducible, dynamic, and elegant books with Quarto. I will also highlight a few features from the recent releases of Quarto that pertain to books (e.g., flexible and custom cross-references, embedding computations from notebooks, and inline code in multiple languages) as well as share examples of how to make your web-hosted books more interactive with tools like webR and shinylive.\n\nTalk by Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel\n\n\nSlides: https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/quarto-books-conf24\nGitHub Repo: https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/quarto-books-conf24",
