  "description": "{mirai} is a minimalist, futuristic, and reliable way to parallelise computations \u2013 either on the local machine, or across the network. It combines the latest scheduling technologies with fast, secure connection types. With built-in integration to {promises}, {mirai} provides a simple and efficient asynchronous back-end for Shiny and Plumber apps. The {crew} package extends {mirai} to batch computing environments for massively parallel statistical pipelines, e.g. Bayesian modeling, simulations, and machine learning. It consolidates tasks in a central {R6} controller, auto-scales workers, and helps users create plug-ins for platforms like SLURM and AWS Batch. It is the new workhorse powering high-performance computing in {targets}.\n\nTalk by Charlie Gao and Will Landau\n\n\nSlides: https://wlandau.github.io/posit2024\nGitHub Repo: https://github.com/wlandau/posit2024\n`mirai`: https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/\n`crew`: https://wlandau.github.io/crew/",
