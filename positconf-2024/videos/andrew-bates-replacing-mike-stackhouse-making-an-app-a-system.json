  "description": "What data processing in your Shiny app is redundant or must happen within the app at all? What makes Shiny beautiful is how it blends data visualization into a compact bundle of code. That said, there are challenges to overcome to get from a developer\u2019s console to users\u2019 screens. Tools like Posit Connect help with this process, but as an app matures, developers and their users may encounter different performance issues. To address this, sometimes this means evolving and introducing separate data pipelines. In this presentation, we will overview some different types of scaling issues for a Shiny app. Additionally, we will introduce the new package {matte}, which provides support for adding data pipelines to your app that live outside Shiny.\n\nTalk by Andrew Bates",
