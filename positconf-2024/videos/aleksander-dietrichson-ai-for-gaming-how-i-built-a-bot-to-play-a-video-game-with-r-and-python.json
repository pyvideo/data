  "description": "I recently undertook to build a robot to play a video game online. Using reinforcement learning, a custom computer vision model, and browser automation \u2013all implemented in R/Python\u2013 I was able to create an AI that played the game to perfection. In this presentation, I will share the lessons learned as I went through this process and some hints to avoid the pitfalls I tackled. I will present some real-world business cases to answer the obvious why-question. For colleagues who teach Data Science and AI, I will show how an activity such as this can provide the entry point and basis for discussion for more than half a dozen topics, ranging from formal logic, game theory, and empirical inference, all the way to Shiny and Quarto.\n\nTalk by Aleksander Dietrichson\n\n\nWrite-up: https://chi2labs.github.io/x-mas-3/q/\nGitHub Repo: https://github.com/chi2labs/x-mas-3",
