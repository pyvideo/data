  "description": "Quarto makes web graphics accessible to data scientists, letting them write Observable JavaScript (OJS) right alongside the languages they already use, like R and Python. OJS is powerful, but making graphics that animate and transition can be a challenge. In this talk I'll demonstrate ways to use Quarto and OJS with graphics libraries to make them react and animate according to your data. We'll even look at making bespoke, reactive graphics with Svelte and D3.js using Sverto, a Quarto extension designed to help you on your web graphics journey.",
