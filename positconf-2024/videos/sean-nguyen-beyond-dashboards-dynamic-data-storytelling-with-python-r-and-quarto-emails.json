  "description": "In this talk, I’ll confront the traditional dependence on dashboards for business intelligence, pointing out their shortcomings in delivering prompt insights to business professionals. I will propose a shift in strategy that employs Python and R to generate dynamic, customized emails, utilizing Quarto and Posit Connect for seamless automation. This technique guarantees direct and effective delivery of actionable insights to users' inboxes, enhancing informed decision-making and boosting engagement. This recommendation not only redefines the method of data delivery for optimal impact but also prompts a fundamental change in mindset among data practitioners, urging them towards a more engaged and individualized form of data narration.",
