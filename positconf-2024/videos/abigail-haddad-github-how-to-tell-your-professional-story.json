  "description": "GitHub is more than just a version control tool, it's a way of explaining your professional identity to prospective employers and collaborators \u2013 and you can build your profile now, before you're looking for new opportunities. This talk is about how to think of GitHub as an opportunity, not a chore, and how to represent yourself well without making developing your GitHub profile into a part-time job. I'll talk about why GitHub adds value beyond a personal website, what kinds of projects are helpful to share, and some good development practices to get in the habit of, regardless of your project specifics.\n\nTalk by Abigail Haddad\n\n\nSlides: https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio-conf/tree/master/2024/abigailhaddad/haddad_2024_posit_slides.pdf",
