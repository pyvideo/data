  "description": "Every day, we face decisions, such as when to purchase a flight ticket to Seattle for posit::conf(2024) when prices change dynamically over time. As a decision scientist, I aim to understand these choices and the cognitive processes underlying them. In my talk, I'll delve into how I leverage both R and Python to decode human decision-making. I'll focus on optimal stopping problems, a common predicament we all encounter, in which a decision-maker must determine the right moment to stop exploring options and make a choice based on their accumulated knowledge. Attendees will be introduced to the field of decision science and learn how R and Python can assist in advancing the study of the human mind.\n\nTalk by Erin Bugbee\n\n\nSlides: https://erinbugbee.quarto.pub/2024positconf-decoding-decisions/\nGitHub Repo: https://github.com/erinbugbee/2024positconf-decoding-decisions",
