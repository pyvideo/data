  "description": "Efficient and scalable analytics workflows are critical for an adaptive and data-driven organization. How can we scale systems to support an office charged with implementing USAID's $6 billion HIV/AIDS program? Our team leveraged R and global health APIs to build more efficient workflows through automation by developing custom R packages to access health program data. Our investment in creating an automated data infrastructure with flexible, open-source tools like R enabled us to build reproducible workflows for analysts in over 50 partner countries. We would like to share our experience in a federal agency integrating APIs with R to develop scalable data pipelines, as inspiration for organizations facing similar resource & data challenges.",
