  "description": "Data Modeling \u2013 what is it, why is it useful, and how dbt makes it easy. \n\nAs a previous R user, I was very skeptical of the value of data modeling when I first came across it. But over time, I realized that it helped organizations scale up analytics practices by standardizing consistent definitions for metrics, improving debuggability for data pipelines, and even enabling rapid experimentation. I want to share this magic with the posit::conf community, and especially how dbt is a tool that's oriented around this practice.\n\nTalk by Kshitij Aranke",
