  "description": "In recent years, high-profile analyses have called attention to many contexts where the use of machine learning deepened inequities in our communities. After a year of research and design, the tidymodels team is excited to share a set of tools to help data scientists develop fair machine learning models and communicate about them effectively. This talk will introduce the research field of machine learning fairness and demonstrate a fairness-oriented analysis of a machine learning model with tidymodels.\n\nTalk by Simon Couch\n\n\nSlides: https://simonpcouch.github.io/conf-24\nGitHub Repo: https://github.com/simonpcouch/conf-24",
