  "description": "Machine learning (ML) solutions are becoming ubiquitous when tackling challenging problems, enabling end-users to access reliable, insightful information. However, many components of these solutions rely on domains outside traditional data science \u2014 e.g., data, DevOps, and software engineering. \n\nIn this talk, I'll walk through an end-to-end ML solution we built for transplant centers to identify likely stem cell donors. We'll then focus on how interacting with domains outside traditional data science can immensely help a project succeed and increase your impact. \n\nYou will take away specific examples of why thinking end-to-end can enhance your ML solutions and how to start applying these principles in your own organization.\n\nTalk by Adam Wang\n\n\nSlides: https://github.com/adamwangdata/posit-conf-2024/blob/main/talk.pdf",
