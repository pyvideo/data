  "description": "From summarizing distributions to pooling operators and measuring the goodness of fit, averaging plays a unique and universally recognized role in the field of machine learning. In the talk we present Generalized Average (GA) - a continuous and fully differentiable average operator that allows for flexible interpolation between min, max and three different types of averages: arithmetic, geometric and harmonic. We share the results of two lines of experiments: (1) using GA in hyperparameter tuning for false-positive-averse cases (e.g. fraud detection) and (2) using GA as a pooling operator in Graph Attention Networks to improve the model\u2019s flexibility. Finally, we present an open-source Python package with our implementation of GA. The talk is addressed to machine learning practitioners, who are interested in enriching their toolbox.\n\nSlides: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aESVbNFytU8gj3lCvxUx4YEuAVkPyfRD\n\nFollow PyData Tel Aviv on:\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/17907513\nhttps://www.facebook.com/PyDataTLV\nhttps://twitter.com/PyDataTLV\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
