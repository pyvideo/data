  "description": "I was about to give up my DBSCAN clustering solution when I found out how long it takes to train it with 400 million records. The density-based clustering algorithm was exactly what we needed at PayPal to solve a few unsupervised anomaly-detection problems, but when runtime hits O(n^2) it just seemed impossible.\n\nThe talk will introduce how we re-implemented DBSCAN for big data by parallelizing it using a graph algorithm, and walk through our solution which enables clustering of 400M records in a few hours.\n\nSlides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Wg5I7GN818H-JayNPxZiD664A3sfzaOc\n\nFollow PyData Tel Aviv on:\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/17907513\nhttps://www.facebook.com/PyDataTLV\nhttps://twitter.com/PyDataTLV\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization.
