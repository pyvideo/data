  "description": "Lightning Talk \n\nThis lecture will present a side project focused on automating a daily task I have been struggling with. I hate choosing what to eat, so I combined my coding hobby with some data I structured to build a dinner-idea suggestion system. I designed the features I needed and learned how to structure a code in a readable way. By structuring the code in an extensible way I made it easier to extend the program to new interfaces, right now having both a CLI and a Streamlit web app that use the same core functions.\n\nSlides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13rES1eqhc4ejmPzoxt36M9bITnWKDdgm\n\nFollow PyData Tel Aviv on:\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/17907513\nhttps://www.facebook.com/PyDataTLV\nhttps://twitter.com/PyDataTLV\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.",
