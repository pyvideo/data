  "description": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of unsupervised learning that are well known for their ability to generate new images, videos or text, but they can also be used for a wider range of use-cases.\nIn this talk I will present how we used GANs at Dell for predicting the user's next activities on Dell\u2019s website, and also cover the fundamentals of GANs, for those less familiar with it and its various applications. You should join this talk if you want to learn the basics of GANs and a less conventional way to use it for a business use-case.\n\nSlides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-eX_Vx_6Y196qwkZksamCXABrUh85RtW-nLGkMd9F4g\n\nFollow PyData Tel Aviv on:\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/17907513\nhttps://www.facebook.com/PyDataTLV\nhttps://twitter.com/PyDataTLV\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.",
