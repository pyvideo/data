  "description": "When dealing with survival analysis, the model's success is predicting death correctly. But it can also predict an engine failure, abandonment, or even purchases.\nIn purchase prediction, survival analysis, or churn prediction, the data is usually labeled or artificially labeled by a set of rules- such as inactivity for 30 days equivalent to churn. But the data structure is different from classical machine learning, and the data handling and modeling are different accordingly.\nIn this lecture, we will cover the data structures and aggregations for such analysis focusing on time aggregations using PySpark and what NLP got to do with any of it.\n\nSlides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AP08NgPga--cuVu8Ao12aPTSv0ex0MCeG2Ksnkavlw8\n\nFollow PyData Tel Aviv on:\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/17907513\nhttps://www.facebook.com/PyDataTLV\nhttps://twitter.com/PyDataTLV\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.",
