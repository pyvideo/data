  "description": "Jupyter Notebooks have seen enthusiastic adoption among the data science community to become the default environment for research.\n\nBut, are Jupyter Notebooks really the best home for data scientists to develop production-ready projects? The non-linear workflow, lack of versioning capabilities, no IDE integration, and inadequate debugging tools make it laborious to productionize a project created in a Jupyter Notebook environment.\n\nShould we just throw our Jupyter Notebooks out the window and move to classic IDEs? Probably not \u2013 Jupyter Notebooks are, after all, a great tool that gives us superhuman abilities. We can, however, be more production-oriented when using them. How does this look in practice? That is exactly what we'll cover in this talk.\n\nSlides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pJPB2cBcM0AQ7lasNTVGQ2Ya9KpfKBmK\n\nFollow PyData Tel Aviv on:\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/17907513\nhttps://www.facebook.com/PyDataTLV\nhttps://twitter.com/PyDataTLV\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.",
