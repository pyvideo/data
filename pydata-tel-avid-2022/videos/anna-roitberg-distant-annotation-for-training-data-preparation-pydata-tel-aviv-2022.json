  "description": "Lightning Talk \n\nDistant Annotation (aka Distant Supervision) is an annotation method that allows training data to be labeled automatically. It has become the standard method for relation extraction tasks. The method utilizes an existing database, such as Freebase, Wikipedia, or a domain-specific database, to collect examples for the relations we want to extract.\n\nSlides: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AkDFM5EK33XcXdZWa9QQyiKelbXwQ1wI\n\nFollow PyData Tel Aviv on:\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/17907513\nhttps://www.facebook.com/PyDataTLV\nhttps://twitter.com/PyDataTLV\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization.
