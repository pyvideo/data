  "description": "Yoel Zeldes & Shuki Cohen\n\nImagine you\u2019re conducting a salary survey with the goal of training a model to predict the salary. Cool, right? Not if you don\u2019t handle user privacy\u2026 How can we make sure the collected data can\u2019t be used to identify the users, while still being able to properly train our model?\n\nIn this session, we\u2019ll eat the cake and leave it whole: We\u2019ll use a less known model called Deming regression to handle our anonymized data, and it\u2019ll have a quality similar to a model trained on the private data! And all will be live coded, starting with an empty Jupyter notebook. Join the fun ;)\n\nFollow PyData Tel Aviv on:\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/17907513\nhttps://www.facebook.com/PyDataTLV\nhttps://twitter.com/PyDataTLV\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
