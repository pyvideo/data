  "description": "Lightning Talk \n\n**Causal ML** brings ML practitioners exciting opportunities to go beyond correlation, with success stories in multiple big tech companies. However, being rooted in the theory of traditional Causal Inference, Causal ML is still less accessible to data scientists who are already juggling to master numerous sub-fields. In this talk we will walk a first step to bridge this gap, by exploring the rich landscape of Causal ML from the data scientist perspective, focusing on \u201cwhat\u2019s in it for us\u201d and which practical tools can be used.\n\nFollow PyData Tel Aviv on:\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/17907513\nhttps://www.facebook.com/PyDataTLV\nhttps://twitter.com/PyDataTLV\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.",
