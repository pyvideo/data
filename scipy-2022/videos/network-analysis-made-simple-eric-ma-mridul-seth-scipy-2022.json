  "description": "Through the use of NetworkX's API, tutorial participants will learn about the basics of graph theory and its use in applied network science. Starting with a computationally-oriented definition of a graph and its associated methods, we will build out into progressively more advanced concepts (path and structure finding, and graph theory's relation to linear algebra), as well as an overview of scalable alternatives to NetworkX.\n\nhttps://ericmjl.github.io/Network-Analysis-Made-Simple/00-preface/01-setup/",
