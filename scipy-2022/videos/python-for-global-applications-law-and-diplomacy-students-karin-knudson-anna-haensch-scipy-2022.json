  "description": "Students in fields like international affairs are increasingly seeking to gain proficiency in data science skills with Python. Such students have the potential to connect data science to its societal context in a sophisticated way. For educators working with such students to support this potential, it is essential to 1) welcome newcomers and center student perspectives and 2) consistently and authentically connect technical content with societal context. We present a framework for teaching Python based introductory data science skills in a highly contextualized and domain flexible environment, based on our experience teaching introductory data science to law and diplomacy students.",
