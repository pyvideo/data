  "description": "Modern neutron powder diffraction experiments demand real-time qualitative analysis and material structural refinement results to steer the experiment. This requires automatic data processing capabilities spanning the neutron data\u2019s life cycle. Automatic Structural Refinement Platform (ASRP) is a python-based software suite that will enable the real-time data reduction, analysis, and visualization for neutron powder diffractometers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The core of ASRP is a platform that supports live data reduction, automatic analysis, and visualization workflow. Several machine-learning empowered powder diffraction data analysis tools are also developed inside ASRP.",
