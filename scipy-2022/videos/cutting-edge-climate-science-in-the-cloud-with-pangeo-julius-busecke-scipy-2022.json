  "description": "Climate change is one of the most challenging issues of our time. To prevent the worst outcomes, we need to drastically accelerate the creation and distribution of scientific knowledge. But the complex and massive datasets produced by numerical climate models render the common 'download and analyze' workflow inefficient, blocking innovative analysis and fast scientific discoveries. \n\nWe present python tools and cloud infrastructure developed within the Pangeo community, enabling cutting edge climate science from a web-browser, making it efficient, reproducible, and inclusive. To demonstrate these capabilities we will reproduce a plot from the IPCC report in a live cloud demonstration.",
