  "description": "The result of any physical and astronomical imaging observation is degraded by both the limited angular resolution of the camera or telescope and measurement noise. By using deconvolution methods the original signal can be partly restored, however this process is especially challenging in the presence of Poisson noise. We compare existing deconvolution algorithms in the Python ecosystem and compare their performance in the low signal to noise regime against improved methods implemented in a dedicated new Python package called Pylira.",
