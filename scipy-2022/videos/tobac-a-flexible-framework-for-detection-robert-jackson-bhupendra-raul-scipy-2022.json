  "description": "tobac is a Python package to identify, track and analyze objects in different types of gridded datasets, such as model simulations, radar volume scans, and satellite images. tobac is a modular package that includes different algorithms for feature identification, tracking, and analyses. Analysis and visualization methods provide a convenient way to use and display the tracking results.\n\nA critical mass of users, contributors, and maintainers is critical for a successful community code. The project is currently extended (Version 1.5 and 2.0 ) by several contributors to include additional workflows and algorithms using the same structure, syntax, and data formats. Version 2.0 will merge the TINT into tobac, and add more features with Xarray capabilities. tobac will serve as a modular platform for performing Lagrangian analyses and evolve into a sustainable choice for tracking and analyzing atmospheric features. \n\n\nDocumentation:\nhttps://tobac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ \n\nSource code:\nhttps://github.com/tobac-project/tobac \nhttps://github.com/openradar/TINT \n\nTutorials:\nhttps://github.com/tobac-project/tobac-tutorials \n\nRoadmap:\nhttps://github.com/tobac-project/tobac-roadmap \n\nReferences:\ntobac https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-4551-2019 \nTINT https://doi.org/10.1175/jamc-d-20-0119.1 \n\nConnect:\nhttps://groups.google.com/g/tobac \nask for slack channel invitation",
