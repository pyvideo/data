  "description": "In this talk we will demo and discuss the work that is being done on Papyri, a new framework to provide rich documentation in Jupyter and Terminal IPython with plots, crosslink, equations. We will describe how libraries can opt-in to this new framework while still in beta to provide feedback, what are the trade-off of using it, the current capabilities and the one planed with current funding, as well as where this could go in the future.\n\nThe current and future progress can be seen on the main repo https://github.com/jupyter/papyri",
