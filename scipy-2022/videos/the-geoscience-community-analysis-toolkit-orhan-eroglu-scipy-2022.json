  "description": "The Geoscience Community Analysis Toolkit (GeoCAT) team develops and maintains data analysis and visualization tools for the geosciences community in the scientific Python ecosystem. In response to dealing with increasing geoscientific data sizes, GeoCAT prioritizes scalability, ensuring its implementations to be scalable from personal laptops to HPC clusters. Another major goal of the GeoCAT team is to ensure community involvement throughout the whole project lifecycle, which is realized through an open development mindset by encouraging the users/contributors to get involved in any decision-making.",
