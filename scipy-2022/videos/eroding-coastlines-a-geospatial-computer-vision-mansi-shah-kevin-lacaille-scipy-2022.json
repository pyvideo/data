  "description": "Satellite data is more widely available than ever before, and it is now possible for the public to access sub-weekly and even daily imagery of the Earth's entire landmass. In this workshop, we will gain hands-on experience exploring publicly-available satellite imagery and using Python tools such as rasterio, numpy, openCV, shapely, and geopandas  for geospatial data analysis and computer vision image analysis of medium- and high-resolution imagery data.  During the second half of the workshop, we will apply what weâ€™ve learned to identify and analyze instances of coastal erosion, one of the most pressing environmental and humanitarian challenges facing our planet today. No previous experience with geospatial or computer vision Python libraries is necessary.\n\nhttp://go.planet.com/scipy2022repo\nhttp://go.planet.com/scipy2022binder",
