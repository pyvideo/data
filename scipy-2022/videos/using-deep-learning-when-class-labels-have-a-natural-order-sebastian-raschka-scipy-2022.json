  "description": "Many real-world prediction problems come with ordered labels, for example, customer satisfaction (dissatisfied, neutral, satisfied), disease severity (none, moderate, severe), and many more. Sure, we can use conventional machine learning and deep learning classifier on such problems, but you will see why that's not ideal. Moreover, you will learn how we can modify any deep neural network classifier such that it takes the ordering information into account -- it requires changing less than five lines of code!",
