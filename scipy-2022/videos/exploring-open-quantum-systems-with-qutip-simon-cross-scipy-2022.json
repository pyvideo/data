  "description": "The second wave of quantum engineering is upon us. The first wave gave us lasers, semiconductors and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. In the second, we're building new kinds of sensors and new materials, sending coherent quantum states over thousands of kilometers, and learning to control complex quantum devices (e.g., \"\"quantum computers\"\"). These new devices are all \"\"open quantum systems\"\" -- i.e. quantum systems that interact with their environment.\n\nIn this tutorial, we'll ignore the hype, and learn how to control four neutral atoms using QuTiP, an open source Python library for simulating open quantum systems. We'll start by looking at the description of single atoms, then at how they evolve with time and interact with other atoms, and finally how they interact with a surrounding environment. We'll combine Python code with visualizations and plots to build intuition for how these systems evolve, and hopefully attendees will leave with a deeper appreciation of what these new devices have to offer, and their limitations and the challenges involved in building them.\n\nNo previous experience with quantum physics required, although there will be some recommended reading beforehand for those who are completely unfamiliar.\n\nhttps://github.com/hodgestar/qutip-scipy-2022",
