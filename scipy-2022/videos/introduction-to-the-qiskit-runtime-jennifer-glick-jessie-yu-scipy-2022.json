  "description": "Tutorial Materials: https://github.com/jenglick/scipy22-qiskit-runtime-tutorial\n\nIn this tutorial, users are introduced to the Qiskit Runtime, a new platform for describing workload execution at the level of programs rather than circuits. \n\nQiskit Runtime enables more complex quantum workloads, driven by algorithms that combine classical and quantum computation in the same execution cycle. \n\nUsers will see how problems ranging from machine learning to chemistry simulation can benefit from this new execution architecture.",
