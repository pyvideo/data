  "description": "In this presentation, we invite the SciPy community to use and contribute to Project Pythia (https://projectpythia.org/), a currently-funded NSF EarthCube project (https://www.earthcube.org/). Project Pythia is a web-based, community-owned, educational resource whose aim is to help teach geoscientists of all stripes and experience levels how to make effective use of the Geoscientific Python Ecosystem for the analysis and visualization of their data. Project Pythia was inspired by, and represents the educational efforts of, the Pangeo project (https://pangeo.io).",
