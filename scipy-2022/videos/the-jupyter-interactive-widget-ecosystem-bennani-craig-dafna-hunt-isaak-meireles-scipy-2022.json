  "description": "Jupyter widgets are powerful tools for building user interfaces with graphical controls such as sliders and text boxes inside a Jupyter notebook. Interactive widgets can also be rendered in Sphinx documentation, nbviewer, and static or interactive web pages. Jupyter widgets are also a framework that makes it easy to build custom GUI controls. Examples of custom widget packages include libraries for interactive 2-D charting, 3-D graphics, mapping, complex controls, and more. This tutorial is accessible to anyone who has prior experience with Python and Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebooks.\n\nThis tutorial begins with an overview of the functionalities provided by the base package:\n\n+ New features in ipywidgets 8.0\n+ The collection of interactions available in ipywidgets\n+ Styling and layouts\n+ Embedding of widgets in contexts other than the Jupyter Notebook\n\nWe will walk the audience through the main functionalities of the core package showing how it can improve their workflow for both the exploratory phase and the presentation of their work.\"\n\nhttps://github.com/jupyter-widgets/tutorial#installation",
