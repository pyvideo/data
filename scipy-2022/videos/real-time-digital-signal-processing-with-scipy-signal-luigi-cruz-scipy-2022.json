  "description": "Frequency-modulated broadcast stations are ubiquitous around the world. Each station is transmitted side-by-side within a contiguous frequency band. In this talk, we discuss the process of demodulating real-world FM stations in parallel with elemental Numpy and SciPy Signal functions. Focusing on techniques, like vectorization, buffering, and frequency-domain filters, to make the computation more computationally efficient to achieve real-time operation. We also discuss how to apply GPU acceleration with CuPy and cuSignal.",
