  "description": "Writing GPU code in Python is easier today than ever, and in this tutorial, I will share what I’ve learned and how you can get started with accelerating your code. You don’t need to learn C++ and you don’t need any special tooling. All you need is an NVIDIA GPU, Python and a few libraries (and we’ll provide that for the tutorial).\n\nhttps://github.com/jacobtomlinson/gpu-python-tutorial",
