  "description": "Dr. Aleksei Gorin, a Neurobiologist and Senior Scientist at Emonomy, provides a talk on \u201cMachine Learning Approaches in Neuroscience.\u201d\n\nAlong with the growth of artificial intelligence and machine learning methodologies, neurobiologists are adopting modern machine learning techniques to tackle a broad spectrum of challenges. Those range from early disease diagnosis to the development of software capable of modeling behavior and natural neural networks.\n\nDuring the talk, Dr. Gorin explores the latest endeavors for integrating machine learning into neuroscience while:\n-discussing the achieved outcomes and their implications for the evolution of brain science methodologies,\n-examining key libraries in computational neuroscience, their role, and offering solutions in data analysis processes.\n-\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
