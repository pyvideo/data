  "description": "Nikolay Karpov, a Senior Research Scientist at NVIDIA NeMo, provides a talk on \u201cHow to prepare a speech dataset and minimize the amount of boilerplate code required?\u201d \n\nProcessing a lot of data for training neural models requires more effort than neural network engineering and training. Nvidia NeMo team has made a Speech Data Processor tool to simplify the process: https://lnkd.in/eHE-KjNC\n\nDuring the talk, you will explore the steps for speech dataset preparation, including:\n\n-Video-to-audio conversion,\n-Metadata parsing,\n-Audio and text language identification,\n-Speech recognition,\n-Text normalization,\n-Filtration by metrics and regular expression.\n--\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
