  "description": "Adam Kulidjian, Chief Technology Officer at Zyphr Solutions Inc., provides a talk on \u201cCrafting Impactful Dashboards for Your Clients.\u201d\n\nCommunicating trends, patterns, and insights through data is integral to understanding the world quantitatively. This phenomenon is used in data science, business intelligence, data analytics, and generally across all scientific disciplines.\n\nA dashboard, particularly one that houses data visualization, is the most common way to do it. With the increased accessibility of dashboard creation tools to people using data, there is a need to effectively communicate data, tell compelling stories, and create affordances that allow others to explore the data themselves.\n\nThe talk offers a handful of heuristics and pragmatic questions that will help you build a better dashboard, regardless of your clients, industry, or use case.\n-\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
