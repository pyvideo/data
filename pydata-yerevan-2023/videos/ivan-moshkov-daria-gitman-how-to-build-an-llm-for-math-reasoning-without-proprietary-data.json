  "description": "Ivan Moshkov, Deep Learning Engineer at NVIDIA, and Daria Gitman, Conversational AI Research Intern at NVIDIA provide a talk on \"How to Build an LLM for Math Reasoning without Proprietary Data?\"\n\nRecent research has shown the value of synthetically generated datasets in training LLMs to acquire targeted skills. Current large-scale math instruction tuning datasets such as MetaMathQA and MAmmoTH rely on outputs from closed-source LLMs that have commercially restrictive licenses. One key reason limiting the use of open-source LLMs in data generation pipelines is the gap in the mathematical skills between the best closed-source LLMs, such as GPT-4, and the best open-source LLMs. \n\nIn their research, Ivan and Daria constructed OpenMathInstruct-1, a math instruction tuning dataset with 1.8M problem-solution pairs using recent progress in open-source LLMs, proposed prompting novelty, and brute-force scaling. Their best model, OpenMath-CodeLlama-70B, trained on a subset of OpenMathInstruct-1, achieves a competitive score of 84.6% on GSM8K and 50.7% on MATH, comparable to top GPT-distilled models. \n\nDuring the talk, Ivan introduces the challenge of math reasoning in Natural Language Processing and discusses the process of creating their synthetic dataset. Following this, Daria explores the Data Explorer tool and shares key insights extracted from the data using this tool. \n\nSlides: https://shorturl.at/GRUFi \n-\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
