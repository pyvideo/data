  "description": "Yuri Orshulevich, Senior NLP Engineer at SuperAnnotate, provides a talk on \"LLM-Generated Text Detection.\" \n\nIn the evolving AI and NLP landscape, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a new era of text generation. Identifying machine-generated content presents a significant challenge with the growing complexity of these models.\n\nThe talk emphasizes the importance of distinguishing machine-generated vs human-written text by exploring possible problems and ways to avoid them. \n\nDuring the talk, you will:\n-Explore the significance of text detection in various domains and ongoing efforts, including competitions. \n-Evaluate the current progress in this area, highlighting the apparent simplicity of a task, which in reality is complex. \n-Examine existing open-source solutions, their limitations, and areas for improvement.\n-Be introduced to a high-quality benchmark that provides a clear way to measure performance.\n\nSlides: https://shorturl.at/fhmpv\n\nGitHub repo: https://github.com/superannotateai/generated_text_detector\n\nHuggingFace model: https://huggingface.co/SuperAnnotate/roberta-large-llm-content-detector\n-\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
