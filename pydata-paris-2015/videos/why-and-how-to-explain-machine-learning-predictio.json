  "description": "Unfortunately, the predictive models that are most powerful are usually\nthe least interpretable. However in some cases, for example fraud\ndetection, end users need an understandable explanation of a particular\nprediction, at observation level, and not only at population level (e.g.\n: features importance). During this talk we will present different\napproaches to tackle this issue, both for random forests and gradient\nboosting trees. We will also demonstrate an implementation based on\nscikit-learn.\n",
