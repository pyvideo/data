  "description": "We all love Docker which helps us a lot in deploying our applications without worrying about what OS we are using and what software versions we have. As a developer you come across a bug every now and then. To solve a bug debug comes very handy. In this talk, I would love to show you one of the ways to debug your flask application within a docker container using VSCode. To do that first, we will build a small flask application and write a Dockerfile for that and run the application. When we want to debug that application we need debugpy package which I don't want to put it in my final docker image so instead of building a different Dockerfile for each purpose we will get to know a bit about Docker multistage build concept and update the current Dockerfile and debug our flask application.",
