  "description": "Speaker:: Jan-Benedikt Jagusch Christian Bourjau\n\nTrack: General: Production\nTaking trained machine learning models from inside a Jupyter notebook and deploying them into a production microservice is painful for two reasons:\r\n\r\n- Models are not fully self-contained and need to be packaged together with their environment\r\n- Models are optimized for batch processing but slow down for single-row predictions, which could lead to timeouts in a fast-paced online microservice.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, you will learn how to use the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) framework to compile models into fully-self contained computational graphs, which can reduce single-row inference time by up to 99%, while also drastically simplifying model management.\r\n\r\nYou will be introduced to the ONNX ecosystem, such as the `sklearn-onnx` and `onnxmltools` libraries for converting models into ONNX graphs, and will learn how to write converters for custom estimators and transformers.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/BLVRVL\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
