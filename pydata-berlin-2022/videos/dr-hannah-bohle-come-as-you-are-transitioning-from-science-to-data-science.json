  "description": "Speaker:: Dr. Hannah Bohle\n\nTrack: General: Community, Diversity, Carreer, Life and everything else\nI would like to give a little insight into my journey from academia to industry. \r\n\r\nI started working as a data scientist after more than a decade in quantitative science and leaving my post-doc position in neuroscience. Now I am often asked by scientists how I made the transition. In my talk, I want to encourage newcomers, show them what they might already bring to the table, help them avoid pitfalls, and explain what I think might be helpful in finding a first job as a data scientist. I'll also touch on the tech stack needed and what role Python plays in that. Come as you are!\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/3L8NHL\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
