  "description": "Speaker:: Andreu Mora\n\nTrack: PyData: Machine Learning & Stats\nCombating fraud, scams and wrongdoings in large marketplaces and platforms that connect millions of individuals as sellers and shoppers poses a very exciting and also difficult problem. Adyen leverages massive transaction information to solve this problem for platforms such as eBay or GoFundMe. In this talk we'll cover how we defined the problem, iterated on it and leveraged open source data tooling over python (airflow, spark, tensorflow, keras) and shallow unsupervised learning to solve it.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/GCVHBH\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
