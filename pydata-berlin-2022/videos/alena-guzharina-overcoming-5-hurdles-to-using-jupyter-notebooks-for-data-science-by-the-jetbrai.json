  "description": "Speaker:: Alena Guzharina\n\nTrack: PyData: Jupyter\nJupyter notebooks have pretty much become the standard for data science and data analysis teams. However, there\u2019s still a number of pain points when it comes to working with them. \r\n\r\nToday we\u2019ll discuss setting up environments, getting data from data providers, writing code without IDE support, and sharing results, as well as collaboration and reproducibility. We\u2019ll also explain how our team tackles these problems in Datalore.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/9D9X8L\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
