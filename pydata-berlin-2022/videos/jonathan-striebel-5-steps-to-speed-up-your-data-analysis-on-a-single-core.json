  "description": "Speaker:: Jonathan Striebel\n\nTrack: PyData: PyData & Scientific Libraries Stack\nYour data analysis pipeline works. \nCould it be faster? Probably.\nDo you need to parallelize? Not yet.\n\nWe'll go through optimization steps that boost the performance of your data analysis pipeline on a single core, reducing time & costs.\nThis walkthrough shows tools and strategies to identify and mitigate bottlenecks,\nand demonstrate them in an example. The 5 steps cover profiling, memory optimizations, and various speedups such as jit-ing with numba.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/VYS8XY\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
