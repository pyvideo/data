  "description": "Speaker:: Stephannie Jimenez Gacha\n\nTrack: PyData: PyData & Scientific Libraries Stack\nWe would like to introduce the consortium of Data APIs, where we will be presenting our motivation, objectives and progress of the standardization process after one year of activity. We will dive into a small history lesson of the current state of the Python data and scientific ecosystem and understand the current fragmentation of the APIs. Then, we will start discussing the efforts of standardization for N-dimensional arrays and dataframes. Finally. we will talk about the roadmap for the next year.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/BMFVFG\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
