  "description": "Speaker:: Katharina Rasch\n\nTrack: PyData: Data Handling\nAre you somewhat comfortable with using SQL to access data, but are curious to know what happens behind the scenes when you send off your query? Then this is the talk for you!\r\n\r\nRelational database systems have been around since the 1970s and they are stacked full of cool ideas and concepts for making data handling fast and secure. And we are still using them, nearly unchanged, 50 years later! Reason enough, I think, to learn a bit more about how they work and the fundamentals of their design.\r\n\r\nAudience level: If you have played around with SQL / written some smaller queries, you\u2019ll be just fine.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/KMFPAN\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
