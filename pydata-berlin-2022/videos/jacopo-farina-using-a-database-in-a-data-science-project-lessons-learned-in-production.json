  "description": "Speaker:: Jacopo Farina\n\nTrack: PyData: Data Handling\nStoring and processing data in a relational database for a machine learning project presents unique challenges. Processing large volumes can take long, source data has to be continuously ingested and kept up to date, the schema needs to change over time while the application is running daily. The amount of available tools and options can be confusing. In this talk, we'll present the solutions and tricks we developed in four years operating a machine learning project in production.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/VUHBWP\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
