  "description": "Speaker:: Florian Wilhelm\n\nTrack: PyData: Machine Learning & Stats\nFeature engineering takes up a huge part in the work-life of a data scientist. Sometimes this doesn't stop at features but also the target variable itself is transformed leading to all kinds of unexpected consequences. In this talk, you will learn about common pitfalls, how a transformation can affect the error measure, the math behind it and even how all this can be used to your advantage.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/7YDWYL\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
