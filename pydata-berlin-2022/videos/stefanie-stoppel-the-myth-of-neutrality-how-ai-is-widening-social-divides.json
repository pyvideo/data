  "description": "Speaker:: Stefanie Stoppel\n\nTrack: General: Ethics\nMany people expect artificial intelligence to be neutral - or at least more objective than we humans are. But is it really? In recent years, researchers and activists have shown that it is in fact not, and that our biases end up becoming part of AI systems. My talk will shed light on how algorithms become discriminatory, how difficult it is to build \"fair and responsible\" AI, and what we should do to prevent the systems we build from cementing existing injustices.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/ML7XNX\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
