  "description": "Speaker:: Alejandro Saucedo\n\nTrack: PyData: Machine Learning & Stats\nAs data science capabilities scale, the core concept of security becomes growingly critical. In this talk we will introduce the security challenges and solutions for data science practitioners relevant to each of the phases of the machine learning lifecycle, and we will provide a practical set of best practices and frameworks that can be adopted to ensure a relevant level of security is present in the multiple stages of the machine learning lifecycle.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/APTWQS\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
