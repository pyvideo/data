  "description": "Speaker:: Jordi Smit\n\nTrack: General: Python & PyData Friends\nMost developers work with Slack every day, yet very few of them know about the awesome things you can do when you build your own slack bot.\r\nFor example, recently, we built a slack bot that automates our hiring assessment sending process. During this talk, we will discuss the lessons we learned during the creation of this slack bot, and we will teach you to build and deploy your first bot.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/SFDVVA\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
