  "description": "Speaker:: Katharine Jarmul Matteo Guzzo Sieer Angar Marielle Dado Emily Gorcenski\n\nTrack: General: Community, Diversity, Carreer, Life and everything else\nWorking in the 21st century is very different from the past. Especially the digital space offers many opportunities to work in the office and remotely. In your hometown or somewhere else on the globe.  Some companies even work completely remotely.  Or, as a freelancer, you can be your own boss. Or running a company, where you are in charge of all the decisions. This panel invites folks with diverse careers to ponder the differences in these choices and give advice to you (and their former selves!) on choices along the way.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/SDQEB8\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
