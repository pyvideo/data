  "description": "Sweeter debugging and benchmarking with ycecream\n[EuroPython 2021 - Talk - 2021-07-29 - Ni]\n[Online]\n\nBy Ruud van der Ham\n\nEven if you use a debugger, it is often required to print some variables or expressions, preferably with their name and sometimes even the location. \nThe normal way to do that is with a print statement, like\n|    print(\"hello= \", hello)\nor with Python &gt;= 3.8:\n|    print(f\"hello=\")\nYcecream makes this easier with a simple call to y:\n|   y(hello)\nand then you will get\n|   y| hello: \"world\"\nBut you can also add the location in the program where this debug call is coming and get something like\n|    y| #6 in testproc() hello: \"world\"\n\nBut ycecream can do much more to help to debug and benchmark Python programs.\nIn this presentation, I will live code to demonstrate ycecream,\n\nThere are some similar packages out there, like IceCream and show. In this talk I will point out some of the main differences.\n\nMore information can be found here:\nwww.github.com/salabim/ycecream\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
