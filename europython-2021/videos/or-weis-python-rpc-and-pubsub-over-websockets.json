Edge deployed software needs realtime communications, updates, and state sync. It needs RPC and PubSub over the web. Lets make it open-source.\n\nIn this talk we'll cover the need for over-the-web realtime RPC and PubSub, why we needed and created it for our OpenPolicyAgent realtime updates layer, along side:\n- The challenges that the implementation faced\n- Pro/Cons of realtime update channels\n- Common use cases (updates, sync, event propagation, distributed computing, authorization, ...)\n- Additional awesome Python open-source we used in this solution (FastApi, Tenacity, broadcaster, ...)\n- How to use the open-source packages we shared.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
