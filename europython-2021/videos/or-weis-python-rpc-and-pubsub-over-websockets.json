  "description": "Python RPC and PubSub over Websockets\n[EuroPython 2021 - Talk - 2021-07-29 - Brian]\n[Online]\n\nBy Or Weis\n\nModern distributed software doesn't stop at your VPC. Edge deployed software needs realtime communications, updates, and state sync. It needs RPC and PubSub over the web. Lets make it open-source.\n\nIn this talk we'll cover the need for over-the-web realtime RPC and PubSub, why we needed and created it for our OpenPolicyAgent realtime updates layer, along side:\n- The challenges that the implementation faced\n- Pro/Cons of realtime update channels\n- Common use cases (updates, sync, event propagation, distributed computing, authorization, ...)\n- Additional awesome Python open-source we used in this solution (FastApi, Tenacity, broadcaster, ...)\n- How to use the open-source packages we shared.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
