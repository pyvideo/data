  "description": "Auto-Sklearn: Automated Machine Learning in Python\n[EuroPython 2021 - Talk - 2021-07-28 - Parrot [Data Science]]\n[Online]\n\nBy Matthias Feurer, Katharina Eggensperger\n\nAutoML makes machine learning accessible for everyone!\n\nMachine Learning is hard since developing well-performing machine learning pipelines requires a lot of expertise, time and manual tuning. AutoML automates this development process by using latest optimization methods to efficiently search for well performing solutions.\n\nIn this talk, we will cover how to move from manually constructing and tuning machine learning pipelines to using efficient hyperparameter optimization algorithms and full AutoML using the popular open-source Auto-sklearn library. Auto-sklearn is a drop-in replacement for any scikit-learn estimator and is developed by the ML Lab of the University of Freiburg.\n\nMore specifically, you\u2019ll learn the following:\n\n\nWhat is AutoML and for what can you use it?\nHow does Auto-sklearn work?\nHow can you use it?\n\n\nThis talk assumes basic understanding of machine learning and statistics. The main target audience are data scientists and domain experts using machine learning. The talk will be designed such that anyone with a basic understanding of machine learning pipelines in scikit-learn and the Python language would be able to understand the concepts and to use our tool.\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
