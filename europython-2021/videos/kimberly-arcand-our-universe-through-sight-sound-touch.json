  "description": "Our Universe through Sight, Sound & Touch\n[EuroPython 2021 - Keynote - 2021-07-29 - Optiver]\n[Online]\n\nBy Kimberly Arcand\n\nInformation of our Universe doesn't have to be just a two-dimensional snap shot. We can transform these data to be able to listen, feel, or (virtually) move through cosmic objects. Listen to the debris from an exploded star, walk through the core of our Milky Way in virtual reality, feel vibrations of a stellar nursery, and experience our universe anew.\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
