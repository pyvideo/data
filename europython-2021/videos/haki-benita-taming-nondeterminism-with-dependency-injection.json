  "description": "Taming Nondeterminism with Dependency Injection\n[EuroPython 2021 - Talk - 2021-07-28 - Ni]\n[Online]\n\nBy Haki Benita\n\nThere are many sources of nondeterminism in code such as randomness, IO, environment variables, databases and many more. Nondeterminism is a source of confusion, and it makes testing difficult. One way to control nondeterminism is using the dependency injection pattern.\n\nIn this talk I'll guide you through a series of problems that demonstrate how nondeterminism can pose incredible challenges even in simple code. Tackling one problem after another, we'll gradually integrate dependency injection into the code to address these challenges!\n\nAfter attending this talk you will hopefully understand:\n\n\nThe challenges nondeterminism poses\nHow to identify nondeterminism in code\nWhat dependency injection is, and how it addresses challenge related to nondeterminism\nHow to implement and integrate dependency injection into Python code\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
