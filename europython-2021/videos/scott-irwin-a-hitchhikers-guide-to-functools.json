  "description": "A Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to functools\n[EuroPython 2021 - Talk - 2021-07-29 - Brian]\n[Online]\n\nBy Scott Irwin\n\nOne of the concepts we learn early in our Python journey is functions. However, Python\u2019s idea of functions goes beyond basic functions; it also supports the idea of higher-order functions - functions that act on or return other functions.\n\nHigher-order functions are useful, powerful, and can save a lot of typing. So, of course, Python\u2019s standard library contains a module of higher-order functions waiting to be used (hint: its called functools).\n\nIn this talk, we will explore functools and look at how its functions can be used to enhance and improve our code.\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
