  "description": "Leveraging Linked Data using Python and SPARQL\n[EuroPython 2021 - Talk - 2021-07-28 - Parrot [Data Science]]\n[Online]\n\nBy Nabanita Roy\n\nWikipedia is the digital encyclopedia that we use daily to find out facts and information. What could be better than being able to extract the extreme wealth of crowd-sourced knowledge from Wikipedia without using traditional web scrapers? Various community-driven projects extract knowledge from Wikipedia and stores them structurally, retrievable using SPARQL. It can be used to mine data for a range of Data Science projects. In this talk, I will walk through the basics of the Open Web and how to use Python to use this huge open database.\nThe agenda includes the following:\n\u2022   Why Wikipedia?\n\u2022      Introduction to DBpedia and Wikidata\n\u2022      Introduction to Linked Data\n\u2022      How to query DBpedia/WikiData\no Build SPARQL Query\no Use Python\u2019s SPARQLWrapper\n\u2022   Python Code Walkthrough to create\no A Tabular Dataset using SPARQL\no A Corpus for Language Models using Wikipedia and BeautifulSoup\no An Use-Case leveraging both SPARQLWrapper and Wikipedia to Create Domain-Specific Corpus \n\nPrerequisites \u2013 Basic knowledge of Python programming, Natural Language Processing, and SQL\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
