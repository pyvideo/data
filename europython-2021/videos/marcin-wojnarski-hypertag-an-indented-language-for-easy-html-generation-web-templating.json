  "description": "Hypertag: an Indented Language for easy HTML Generation & Web Templating\n[EuroPython 2021 - Talk - 2021-07-28 - Brian]\n[Online]\n\nBy Marcin Wojnarski\n\nHYPERTAG (http://hypertag.io) is a full-featured standalone language for HTML templating and document generation. Inspired by indentation-based template languages (Slim, Haml, Shpaml, Pug), it provides clean, readable syntax and multiple original features that enhance code reuse and modularity: native custom tags, DOM manipulation, Python-like granular imports, control blocks, compound expressions, and more.\n\nHypertag can be called directly from Python code, or be plugged as a template backend into Django. Hypertag scripts can utilize all of Django's filter functions out of the box. Hypertag is not limited to HTML alone, but can be adapted to produce different markups.\n\nDocs:   http://hypertag.io\nGitHub: https://github.com/mwojnars/hypertag\nPyPI:   https://pypi.org/project/hypertag-lang/\n\nDuring the talk, Hypertag's syntax will be presented with particular focus on original features not found elsewhere (custom native tags, DOM manipulation, granular imports). The talk will be illustrated with examples, and a comparison with existing template languages will be shown.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
