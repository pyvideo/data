  "description": "Python Versions and Dependencies Made Easy\n[EuroPython 2021 - Talk - 2021-07-28 - Optiver]\n[Online]\n\nBy Sebastian Witowski\n\nManaging Python versions and dependencies can be painful. JavaScript developers have their \"nodemodules\" folders, but we don't have \"pythonmodules\" (yet!) in Python. Instead, we have those mysterious virtual environments. And if you also want to switch between different Python versions, it can quickly turn into a mess.\n\nIt doesn't have to be that way. With a few simple tools and practices, you can easily tame Python and its dependencies. In this talk, I'm going to show you how to do this.\n\nI will talk about:\n\n\nHow to manage Python versions with pyenv and set different versions for a folder or a shell session?\nWhat are virtual environments, what's the difference between different tools (venv, virtualenvwrapper, conda, etc.), and how to use them?\nHow to separate global packages with pipx (and why you should do this)\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
