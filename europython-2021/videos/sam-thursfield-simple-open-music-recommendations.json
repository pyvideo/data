Expect to see small-tech solutions for music recommendations based around GNOME's Tracker search engine and the open, community-powered database Musicbrainz.\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
