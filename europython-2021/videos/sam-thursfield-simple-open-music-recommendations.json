  "description": "Simple, open, music recommendations\n[EuroPython 2021 - Talk - 2021-07-30 - Ni]\n[Online]\n\nBy Sam Thursfield\n\nCan simple open source tools compete with the music recommendations provided by Spotify and other big names?\n\nThis talk will look at how the open source world can stay relevant in a world where music listening has become dependent on commercial streaming services and users expect an element of recommendations. Expect to see small-tech solutions for music recommendations based around GNOME's Tracker search engine and the open, community-powered database Musicbrainz.\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
