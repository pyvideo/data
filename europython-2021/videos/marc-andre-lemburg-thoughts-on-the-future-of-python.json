The talk will look into the current state, upcoming changes and explore possibilities for its future development, both at a language and application level.\n\nThe talk looks at Python's development from a higher level point of view, using a more business oriented approach and analyzing the perspective from a corporate C-level user.\n\nIt's an updated version of the talk I've given at Driving IT 2020 and include more recent developments: https://ida.dk/viden-og-netvaerk/videoer-fra-ida/kategorisider/videoer-it-og-innovation/driving-it-talks-thoughts-on-the-future-of-python\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
