  "description": "Refactoring legacy Django app using OOP\n[EuroPython 2021 - Talk - 2021-07-28 - Optiver]\n[Online]\n\nBy Sebastian Buczyński\n\nEvery year we can hear rumours about the demise of Object-Oriented Programming. As usual, they are greatly exaggerated. In 2021 OOP still has a lot to offer. The problem is a shortage of good quality materials that would show where it shines and how a Pythonista can leverage it without writing code that looks like Java from the 00s.\n\nI'll show you how you can refactor legacy code in a Django app and tame complex logic living there.\n\nValue for attendees: see refactoring possible directions and get to know 3 OOP stereotypes\nLevel of attendees: intermediate & advanced\nExpected knowledge: Experience with building web apps, at least superficial knowledge about Django\n\nThis talk is an introduction to 3 out of 8 OOP Stereotypes, i.e. Controller, Interfacer and Information Holder. They'll be introduced using a real-life legacy project refactoring.\n\nFor the purpose of this talk, I'll be using code from this repo: https://github.com/Enforcer/django-refactor\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
