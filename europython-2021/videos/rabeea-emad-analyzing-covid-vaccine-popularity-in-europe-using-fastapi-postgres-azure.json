  "description": "Analyzing COVID Vaccine Popularity in Europe Using FastAPI, Postgres & Azure\n[EuroPython 2021 - Talk - 2021-07-30 - Ni]\n[Online]\n\nBy Rabeea Emad\n\nFastAPI is one of the fastest growing Python web frameworks \u2013 in part due to its ease of usage and high performance. In this talk, I will teach you how you can rapidly process European covid vaccine popularity data using Fire, place it into Azure Database for Postgres (for free!) and then leverage FastAPI to serve them through a back-end. Finally, I will launch the backend online through Azure App Service and use Jupyter to visualize the data from the API to answer interesting questions! Come join me and let the adventure begin!\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
