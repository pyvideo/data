(type hinting, docstrings, inline comments et cetera)\nWhat's a clean, navigatable project structure?\nShould the tests package be nested into each package?\nShould my 'tests' package structure mirror the project structure? (for easy navigation of which module/package is being tested)\n(Testing) What should I test and what shouldn't I test?\n(Testing) When should I mock and when shouldn't I?\n(Testing) Writing clean test cases\n(Testing) Using pytest to utilize parametrize to test multiple combinations, whilst keeping a clean codebase\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
