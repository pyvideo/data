  "description": "Managing transient dependencies\n[EuroPython 2021 - Talk - 2021-07-28 - Ni]\n[Online]\n\nBy Joel Christiansen\n\nPython packaging has come a long way since the days of easy_install and eggs. With the advent of wheels, and more recently pyproject.toml and PEPs 518, 517, and 621, the future looks bright for the world of python build tool. I will briefly explore the history of python packaging, and look at how we can take advantage of these developments to increase reliability and safety in python build tools.\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
