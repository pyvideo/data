  "description": "A Tale Of Python C Extensions And Cross-Platform Wheels\n[EuroPython 2021 - Talk - 2021-07-30 - Optiver]\n[Online]\n\nBy Vinayak Mehta\n\nHave you ever wondered why Python is referred to as CPython and what is the Python C-API everyone keeps talking about? Come to this talk and find out! We'll briefly take a look at the C-API, how we can use it to extend Python's functionality, and how we can write Python C extensions using pybind11.\n\nAfter writing our Python C extension, we'll package it so users on all major operating systems can easily install it using pip. We'll take a look at how we can do this by building cross-platform wheels for Linux, macOS, and Windows and automatically pushing them to PyPI!\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
