  "description": "Python Anti-Patterns\n[EuroPython 2021 - Talk - 2021-07-29 - Brian]\n[Online]\n\nBy Vinicius Gubiani Ferreira\n\nMost people heard at least once or focused really hard on studying design patterns. But did you know there are also lots of anti-patterns we should try to avoid?\n\nIn this talk I intend to present some of the most known anti-design patterns that we'll promise never to use ... but for some reason or slip end up using it anyway. I will start showing more generic anti-patterns that apply to all languages and software in general, and move on to Python specifics, by using The Little Book of Python Anti-Patterns.\n\nSince there will be Python code, attendees should fell confort with some basic to intermediate Python knowledge. For example: know about classes, constructors, parameters/arguments, etc.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
