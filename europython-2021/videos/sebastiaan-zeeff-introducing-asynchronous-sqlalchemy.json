  "description": "Introducing Asynchronous SQLAlchemy\n[EuroPython 2021 - Talk - 2021-07-28 - Parrot [Data Science]]\n[Online]\n\nBy Sebastiaan Zeeff\n\nWith the increasing popularity of asynchronous frameworks, such as FastAPI, communicating asychronously with databases has become a hot topic in Python development. While there were already a lot of database drivers with asynchronous support available, support for asynchio in Object-Relation Mapping (ORM) frameworks was a lot rarer. That is, until the release of version 1.4 of SQLAlchemy back in March of 2021, which added support for Asynchronous I/O to one of the most popular ORM frameworks for Python.\n\nIn this talk, Sebastiaan Zeeff will give an overview of the newly added support for asyncio in SQLAlchemy. He will go over how easy it is to set up and use the new AsyncEngine, show you how to avoid getting bitten by some of the pitfalls, and explain how you can use the synchronous functions and methods of SQLAlchemy under asyncio.\n\nWhile this talk is an introduction to SQLAlchemy's asyncio support, it is aimed at those who already have some experience with ORM and asyncio. Extensive knowledge of SQLAlchemy is not required, although having a bit of experience with the framework won't hurt.\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
