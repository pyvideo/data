  "description": "Towards a sustainable solution to open source sustainability\n[EuroPython 2021 - Talk - 2021-07-28 - Optiver]\n[Online]\n\nBy Tobie Langel\n\nA few years ago, Heartbleed epitomized a massive open source sustainability problem for critical parts of the internet infrastructure. The bug, which affected the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library, notably compromised the confidentiality of 4.5 million US patient records and cost the industry an estimated $500M.\n\nIt was soon revealed that the root cause of the issue was that OpenSSL was precariously understaffed. Open source sustainability became a major theme overnight. Stories of maintainer burn-out made the headlines. And tentative solutions started to emerge, most of them donation-based.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll explore a number of existing strategies to fund open source and make it more sustainable, from patronage to dedicated ad networks. And we\u2019ll defend the idea that the best path to open source sustainability is to help companies understand the tangible business value they can get from contributing to open source.\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
