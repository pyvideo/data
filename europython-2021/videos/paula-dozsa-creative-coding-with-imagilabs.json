We created the imagiCharm, a programmable smart accessory, so that code and be brought to life and shown off! The imagiLabs app (iOS, Android, and web) is a truly social, inclusive platform for teenage girl coders to develop their skills. We also partner with schools, non-profits, and coding companies to bring groups of students our innovative coding curriculum. \n\nThis 1 hour virtual session takes coders from lighting up one pixel at a time to making colorful animations in the imagiLabs app. Ideal for kids 8-16, but truly fun for all ~ learn the basics of Python with our creative coding tools!\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
