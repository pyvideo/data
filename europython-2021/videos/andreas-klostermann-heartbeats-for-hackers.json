  "description": "Heartbeats for Hackers\n[EuroPython 2021 - Talk - 2021-07-29 - Brian]\n[Online]\n\nBy Andreas Klostermann\n\nPulse sensors have found their way into a surprising number of devices, and they are useful in many kinds of contexts, most of all in medical ones.\nThis talk will cover mostly \"electrocardiography\", the electrical way to listen to your heart. I will cover briefly how the heart works, how ECG sensors work and how to build a simple ECG with an Arduino or similar microcontrollers.\nThen I will show you a bit about how to analyze such data and do some machine learning.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
