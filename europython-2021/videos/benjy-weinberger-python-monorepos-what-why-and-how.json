  "description": "Python monorepos: what, why and how\n[EuroPython 2021 - Talk - 2021-07-30 - Brian]\n[Online]\n\nBy Benjy Weinberger\n\nAs organizations and repos grow, we have to choose how to manage codebases in a scalable way. We have two architectural alternatives:\n\n\nMultirepo: split the codebase into increasing numbers of small repos, along team or project boundaries.\nMonorepo: Maintain one large repository containing code for many projects and libraries, with multiple teams collaborating across it.\n\n\nIn this talk we'll discuss the advantages of monorepos for Python codebases, and the kinds of tooling and processes we can use to make working in a Python monorepo effective. \n\nAt the end of this talk you will understand the tradeoffs of different codebase architecture choices, and how to evaluate tooling and processes that keep your repo humming along at scale.\n\nNo prior knowledge is required.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
