  "description": "High Performance Data Processing with Python, Kafka and Elasticsearch\n[EuroPython 2021 - Talk - 2021-07-30 - Parrot [Data Science]]\n[Online]\n\nBy Harshit Prasad\n\nIn the current technology era, all kind of applications work on data. Data is used to represent a set of information. The healthcare apps, e-commerce apps etc works on data. Sometimes, this data needs to be get updated to reflect new changes across the platform. This action can be performed manually but what if platform data is getting updated in realtime or let\u2019s say in every 1 hour? Such kind of problem can be solved by implementing a service based on Producer Consumer model.\n\nIn this talk, I will be covering how Producer Consumer models work and how such design pattern can be implemented with Python. I will be explaining the whole implementation process using other tools such as Kafka as data streamer and Elasticsearch as data store.\n\nTalk Outline:\n\n1. Problem Statement (2 mins) \nIntroduction to problem statement.\n\n2. Introduction to Producer Consumer Model (3 mins)\nBasics of Producer Consumer Model\nApplications\n\n3. Deep-dive explanation of Producer Consumer model using example (5 mins)\nElasticsearch\nKafka\n\n4. Explaining parts of our Producer Consumer model (5 mins)\nWhat kind of data are we updating in our data store?\nWhy it\u2019s a high performance solution?\nImplementation in Python as end-to-end framework.\n\n5. Code walkthrough (5 mins)\nProduce data\nStream data\nConsume data\n\n6. Conclusion and Learnings (5 mins)\nLearnings\nPerformance Pros and Cons\n\n7. Q/A Session (5 mins)\n\n\nTarget Audience - Beginner / Intermediate\nProposal Section - Web based Systems\nPrerequisites - Python &amp; System Design\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
