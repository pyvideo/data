  "description": "Generators, coroutines, and nanoservices\n[EuroPython 2021 - Talk - 2021-07-29 - Optiver]\n[Online]\n\nBy Reuven Lerner\n\nGenerator functions have been a part of Python for many years already, and are a well known technique for creating iterators. But generators have a few lesser-known aspects, including their \u201csend\u201d method and the \u201cyield from\u201d syntax. Many Python developers shy away from using them, unsure of what they would do, or how they would be useful \u2014 seeing coroutines as a solution looking for a problem.\n\nIn this talk, I\u2019ll tell you why coroutines can be useful, and how thinking about them as in-process \u201cnanoservices\u201d puts us in the right frame of mind to determine when they would and wouldn\u2019t be appropriate. Among the topics we\u2019ll explore are:\n\nGenerator function basics\nnext vs. send\nHow to build a coroutine\nThinking of coroutines as nanoservices\nSub-coroutines\nThe need for yield from\nUsing yield from\nIdeas for general usage\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
