  "description": "Django with PostgreSQL superpowers\n[EuroPython 2021 - Talk - 2021-07-28 - Ni]\n[Online]\n\nBy Paolo Melchiorre\n\nEvery time we\u2019re going to create a new project with Django we make assessments on its requirements to choose the best architecture, of which, the database is usually the core.\n\nDjango is a database-agnostic web framework but natively supports only 4 Open Source databases: PostgreSQL, SQLite, MariaDB and MySQL.\n\nPostgreSQL has the richest feature set of any supported database and some of these features are natively supported directly in Django via its contrib module.\n\nIn this talk we\u2019ll see how to use to our advantage the features of PostgreSQL as a database in Django, its exclusive features present in its contrib module and also other superpowers that can be exploited through the use of third-party packages.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
