  "description": "Continuous Documentation for your code\n[EuroPython 2021 - Talk - 2021-07-28 - Optiver]\n[Online]\n\nBy Anastasiia Tymoshchuk\n\nDo you document your code? Do you think it is important?\n\nImagine that you need to get back to your code in 6 month after you wrote it, there is always a big possibility that you will have to spend some time to find out how this code works. Or if someone else wrote some code, which is already in production and your task is to fix a bug in it and there is no documentation and no one actually knows what this code does.\n\nThere are more benefits of implementing continuous documentation for the code:\n\n\neasy to onboard new team members,\neasy to share knowledge,\nif this code is open source - easy to start contributing,\neasy to see purpose and motivation of each piece of code,\neasy to keep versioning for each new release of the code.\n\n\nIn this talk you will see the difference between documentation types and a demo in the end of the talk.\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
