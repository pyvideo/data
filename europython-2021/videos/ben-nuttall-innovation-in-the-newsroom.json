  "description": "Innovation in the newsroom\n[EuroPython 2021 - Talk - 2021-07-28 - Brian]\n[Online]\n\nBy Ben Nuttall\n\nIn BBC News Labs, we're always looking for ways to innovate without requiring production teams to change their workflows. We investigated ways we could enrich our digital output by extracting detailed information about the contents of our TV and radio programmes from their running orders.\n\nLike many traditional broadcasters, the BBC uses the MOS Protocol for communications between newsroom computers and servers where media files such as audio and video are stored.\n\nProduction teams create running orders using enterprise broadcasting tools, and every time they add details or make changes, XML messages are emitted by the newsroom computer systems. We've created a way to process these messages to build up a machine-readable version of the running order.\n\nWe developed a general solution for dealing with MOS messages - a Python library called mosromgr (MOS running order manager). It's based on open standards and could be useful to other broadcasting organisations, so we've released it under an open source licence.\n\nThis library was developed by the BBC News Labs team as part of a series of projects based around extracting information from running orders from the BBC's TV and radio programmes.\n\nThis talk aims to share the detail of our innovation projects investigating personalisation, automatic chapterisation and live notifications, and showcases our Python library and AWS pipeline.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
