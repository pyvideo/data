  "description": "Streamlit: The Fastest Way to build Data Apps\n[EuroPython 2021 - Talk - 2021-07-30 - Parrot [Data Science]]\n[Online]\n\nBy Steven Kolawole\n\nWhen we think about building Python-based data science apps, we think of Flask. But there is a better option now. Streamlit.\n\nStreamlit is an open-source web framework that lets you create apps for your machine learning projects with deceptively simple Python scripts, in hours. It supports hot-reloading, so your app updates live as you edit and save your file. No need to mess with HTTP requests, HTML, JavaScript, etc. In a short sentence, there is no need to write any front-end code. All you need is your favorite editor and a browser.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll go through how to build a very simple Streamlit app step-by-step. I will also review the pros and cons of Streamlit, as regards other popular Python web frameworks being used by Data Scientists and ML Engineers.\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
