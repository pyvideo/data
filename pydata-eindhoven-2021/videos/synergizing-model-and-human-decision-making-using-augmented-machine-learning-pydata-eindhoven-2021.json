  "description": "For our credit risk modelling, we love to use machine learning models to support human decision-making. The past two years we worked hard towards making our models more transparent to support our risk department. We also democratised our data by making it available to everyone in the company.\nIn my talk, I will introduce you to our approach of augmenting our machine learning and fuelling our feedback loop to continuously improve on our features and modelling approaches. Elements will include:\n-Co-designing a business rule model together with domain experts \n-Increasing transparency by sharing feature descriptions with our predictions\n-Gathering feedback by providing model explanations with Shapley values\n-How models and the risk department collaborate using challenges\n\nKay:  is a Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer at Floryn, a FinTech based in 's-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands. At Floryn he builds, deploys and monitors models to predict the financial health of companies. He likes to find pragmatic solutions to complicated problems and enjoys managing projects to bring value in a structured manner.\nGitHub: https://github.com/kayhoogland/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kay-hoogland//\nWebsite: https://www.kayhoogland.nl/\n\nPyData Eindhoven 2021\nWebsite: https://pydata.org/eindhoven2021/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataeindhoven\n\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
