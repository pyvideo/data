  "description": "In particular, I'll discuss:\n-a general method to calm down optimistic claims of optimal results\n-how easy it is to draw the wrong lesson when running a grid-search\n-how data is a much better proxy for interpretation than hyperparameters\n-how easy it is to find wrong labels in public datasets\n-why sentiment models are generally a bit strange\n-tricks to deal with some of these issues\n\nThere will also be a demo, and an announcement, of a new python project\n\nMy name is Vincent, ask me anything. I have been evangelizing data and open source for the last 7 years. You might know my from tech talks where I attempt to defend common sense over hype in data science.\nCurrently, I work as a Research Advocate at Rasa where I collaborate with the research team to explain and understand conversational systems better.\n\nIn my spare time, I maintain a suite of open source packages (scikit-lego, human-learn, whatlies, tokenwiser, clumper, memo, pytest-duration-insights, mktestdocs, and more). I'm also building some online services (calmcode.io and dearme.email).\nGithub: https://github.com/koaning/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/fishnets88/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincentwarmerdam//\nWebsite: https://koaning.io/\n\nPyData Eindhoven 2021\nWebsite: https://pydata.org/eindhoven2021/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataeindhoven\n\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
