  "description": "While the potential of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is widely recognized in various sectors (health, industry, commerce, etc.), regretfully many ML/AI projects do not make it past the Proof of Concept (PoC) stage. In this talk I will share a number of my own experiences with \u201cfailed\u201d AI projects (i.e., projects that easily passed the PoC stage, but never made it into production), and I will examine the root causes of these failed AI projects. To do so, I will have to provide a bit more background regarding the various types of AI models/projects that exists, explain how AI works in some detail, and discuss the common production/deployment patterns that companies use in their attempts to scale their ML/AI activities. Effectively, I will describe the AI deployment process from data collection, to AI model development, to model evaluation, and finally towards large scale model deployment. At each of these stages I will highlight the challenges involved and the common points of failure.\nNext, I will turn my talk to potential solutions: although it is hard to find a uniform solution for scaling every possible ML/AI solution in the book, for a large class of applied AI/ML models efficient and effective deployment methods have recently been developed. I will explain how deploying AI models on the edge (i.e., not in the cloud) solves a number of common AI deployment problems. Furthermore, I will explain how modern technological advances enable the effective deployment of trained ML/AI models on edge devices despite the diversity in device types (e.g., different hardware, different computational constraints). Finally, I will argue that deployment on the edge makes applied AI more scalable, reduces the energy footprint of AI, improves user privacy, and reduces operational costs of many AI applications.\n\nPyData Eindhoven 2021\nWebsite: https://pydata.org/eindhoven2021/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataeindhoven\n\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
