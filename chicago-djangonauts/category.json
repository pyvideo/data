  "description": "We meet periodically at various locations throughout Chicagoland to talk\nof things Django. Since the group's reanimation in 2011, we've met\nseveral times at Imaginary Landscape, enjoyed a private tour of\nMetropolitan Brewing, eaten many pizzas and waxed poetic about our\nfavorite framework.\n\nMost of our ongoing conversation takes place the Chicago Djangonauts\nGoogle Group. Please follow the link and join the discussion.\n\nThe closest thing we have to an organizer is Brian Moloney. Feel free to\ncontact him directly (brian at imagescape dot com) if you find a\nbriefcase full of cash that needs safekeeping.\n",
