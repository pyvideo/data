  "description": "Whether for a CEO in a boardroom or a family creating next month\u2019s budget, people need continual access to data. Problems occur when web applications used to visualize large datasets reach browser limits for the number of open connections that can be created, due to multiple queries. To overcome this limitation, presenters will discuss asynchronous methods of retrieving data, focusing on Python Celery. Celery task queues distribute data queries while the web application polls for results, creating a better user experience.\n\nSlides: https://noti.st/hustjl22/n3KqaM/optimizing-data-retrieval-with-python-celery",
