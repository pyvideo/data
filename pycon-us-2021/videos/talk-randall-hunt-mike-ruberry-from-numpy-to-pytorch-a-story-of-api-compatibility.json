  "description": "NumPy has grown to be a vital part of the data science workflow for everyone from astrophysicists to zoologists. This talk is about how PyTorch approaches being \u201cNumPy-compatible,\u201d and why the PyTorch community thinks that\u2019s important, why it can be challenging, and why sometimes it\u2019s necessary to be divergent from NumPy\u2019s behavior.\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/MikeRuberry1/from-numpy-to-pytorch",
