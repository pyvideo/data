  "description": "This tutorial is a chance to get hands-on with PyTorch and GPU Deep Learning (DL). It is specifically targeted toward attendees who may be familiar with the concepts of DL, but want practical experience. Familiarity with Python and typical ML packages (e.g. pandas, numpy, sklearn) is expected.\n\nAt the end of this session, you will understand how to:\nBuild some common DL architectures in PyTorch\nEvaluate and improve the performance\nTake advantage of more compute (and when you should do so)\n\nThis will set you up to take advantage of interesting developments in the field and maybe even contribute your own!",
