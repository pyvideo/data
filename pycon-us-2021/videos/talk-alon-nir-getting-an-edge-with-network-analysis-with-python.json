  "description": "Networks are all around us. While Facebook and Twitter are the obvious examples, every time we shake hands, drive from point A to B, push code to github, check out a meetup or rate a show on IMDB, we\u2019re participating in network activity. People, places, things and even ideas are inter-connected in innumerable networks, and these can have a great (yet sometimes inconspicuous) impact on our lives.\n\nThe purpose of this talk is to introduce members of the audience to network analysis and its importance, and give them the basic building blocks for applied network analysis with Python.\n\nSlides: https://github.com/alonnir/PyCon-Us-2021-Talk/",
