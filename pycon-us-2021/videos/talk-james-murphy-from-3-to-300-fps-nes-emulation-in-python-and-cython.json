  "description": "It is sometimes asserted that \u201cPython is a real bad choice for any kind of real-time system\u201d. When I first got my Python NES emulator to boot, only for it to run at 2 frames per second, I felt like agreeing. But is it really true? After just a few days reworking the emulator\u2019s operational core into Cython, the framerate is now above 300fps, proving that Python is a viable choice for emulator development and other performance-dependent projects. In this talk, I will outline the advantages and some challenges of using Cython to achieve realtime performance from an existing Python codebase.\n\nSlides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTj4Y7KEy5hhOlYKqbSdUDbFLol4tw91Qvn7otLdFTb-rCwhP4kLKYieYUzhcDnV9OGtgxuraQV3-ep/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000",
