  "description": "What are regular expressions, what are they useful for, and why are they so hard to read?\n\nIn this tutorial we will break down the regular expression syntax to better understand how they work. We will learn how to dissect regular expressions, how to use regular expressions in Python, and how to make your regular expressions more readable (yes it's possible... sort of).\n\nWe will learn how to use regular expressions for data validation, data parsing, and data normalization. We'll also discuss when not to use regular expressions.",
