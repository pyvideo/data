  "description": "The Python Virtual Training Summit seeks to present how community organizations, trainers, meetup groups, classrooms, and employers have facilitated Python training and mentorship to a virtual environment.\n\nVirtual Training Summit talks will be focused on showcasing the strategies and methods that have been used over the past years to facilitate the formal and informal training needed in highly technical organizations.
