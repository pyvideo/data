  "description": "Scalene is a high-performance CPU and memory profiler for Python that does a number of things that other Python profilers do not and cannot do. It runs orders of magnitude faster than other profilers while delivering far more detailed information. This talk will present case studies of using Scalene, and describe some of the technical advances that make it work.\n\nSlides: https://www.cs.umass.edu/~emery/scalene-pycon2021.pdf",
