  "description": "Although users typically arrive at doc websites in a confused and\nimpatient state, not sure of where to find what they're looking for,\ngood navigation can guide them to the right answer. Good navigation\nanticipates users' needs, provides links in commonly viewed places, and\nbrings the right topic into the foreground amid hundreds of other\ntopics.\n\nAs you build out the navigation for your doc site, follow these 5 design\nprinciples:\n\n-  **Entry point**. Design the entry point to your system to orient\n   users and allow them to easily get started.\n\n-  **Hierarchy**. Create a hierarchical outline of the content to help\n   users both understand and visualize the body of information.\n\n-  **Modularity**. Break up content into independent topics that can be\n   viewed, understood, and updated independent of the whole.\n\n-  **Progressive disclosure**. Layer the information so that you don't\n   present everything at once but rather make some content available\n   only at secondary or tertiary levels.\n\n-  **Wayfinding**. Provide navigational signposts — \n   such as breadcrumbs and workflow maps — to help\n   orient users as to where they are in a larger system.\n",
