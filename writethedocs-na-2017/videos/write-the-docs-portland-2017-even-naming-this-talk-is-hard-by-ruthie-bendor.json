  "abstract": "Writers of software and writers of documentation practice a shared art:\nwe bestow abstractions with names. We know we''ve succeeded when our\nnames illuminate concepts, elicit a-ha moments, and empower users to put\nour product to work. We know we''ve failed when the names we''ve chosen\nconfuse, frustrate, misguide, or offend.\n\nNaming things well matters. Too often, though, good names are hard to\ncome by, and bad names are hard to change.\n\nUsing a lengthy and ever-growing list of Terrible, Horrible, No Good,\nVery Bad names encountered during my career as an engineer, this talk\nwill address: - Why is it so hard to name things well in software? - Why\ndo bad names persist? - What are some heuristics for assessing how good\nor bad a name is? - How has technology hampered efforts to name things\nwell? - How can technology help our efforts to name things well? - How\ncan documentarians and developers work together to name things better?\n",
