  "abstract": "In this talk I'll discuss the partnership between documentarians and\nsupport and how that relationship can embolden your customers.\n\nDocumentation can make or break a support interaction. Your average\ncustomer or client isn't interested in a lot of work to use your\nproduct. They need to know how to make your product do \"the thing\"\nwithout, say, opening a Rails console, or doing some other godforsaken\nprogramming trick that you know.\n\nYou might not know this but your support team has a life of its own that\nyou haven't seen. Having been a documentarian in the context of a\nsupport team, I have some pretty interesting things to talk about how\nyou can weave relationships to make everyone's life better, all the way\nup the food chain.\n\nI'll talk about how working in partnership with your support team can\nnot only focus your docs to the points that matter, but let you see how\noperating as connective tissue between departments makes everyone's life\neasier.\n",
