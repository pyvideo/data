  "description": "Writers often forget that users are more likely to see error messages,\ntooltips, and helper text than to search for documentation. But these\nbits of microcopy are actually an opportunity to communicate and connect\nwith users when they most need it. Most errors say that something went\nwrong, but the user doesn''t know if it''s their fault or what to do\nabout it. As writers, designers, and developers, we need to help them\nfix the problem and teach them what to do next time.\n\nMicrocopy is also a chance to create a friendly relationship and\nestablish your brand with your audience. Users are less likely to get\nfrustrated if the error message has a personal and human sentiment than\nif it merely says \"ACCESS DENIED\", or \"FORBIDDEN ACTION\".\n\nIn this talk I show how making error message Humble, Human, and Helpful\nis critical to making your users Happy. We''ll laugh at a few bad\nerrors, and learn from the good error messages and microcopy.\n",
