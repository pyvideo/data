  "description": "Getting feedback on your work is a necessary part of any project, and it\nmakes your output stronger and more diverse. But it can be hard when\nyour work is being evaluated. Sometimes, it feels like your reviewers\nhave a deep and abiding interest in pain. You'll never succeed! You may\nas well die here! Well, you have already succeeded just by asking for\nfeedback. Together, we'll discuss how to build up your tolerance for\ntaking that feedback.\n\nFeedback became so much easier for me when I learned design critique\nguidelines from a co-worker and UX Designer. Design critique guidelines\nare a set of rules and practices that can make getting and giving\nfeedback easier. This presentation passes along the strategies I learned\nso you can implement design critique guidelines into your review process\nand make feedback painless.\n",
