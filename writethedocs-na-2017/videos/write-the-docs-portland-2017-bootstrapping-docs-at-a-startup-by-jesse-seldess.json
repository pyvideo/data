  "description": "How do you \u201cbootstrap docs\u201d? In this talk, I will walk through how to\nbuild essential docs for an early stage startup that lays a strong\nfoundation for continuous improvement and expansion. The story will be\ntold through my experiences building docs from scratch for CockroachDB\n(https://www.cockroachlabs.com), a next-generation open source database.\n\nWhen I joined Cockroach Labs as its first technical writer, CockroachDB\nhad been in development for nearly two years and had 15 engineers and\n60+ open source developers contributing to it. I needed to build a\ndocumentation structure and process that would be lightweight enough for\ndevelopers to contribute to and flexible enough to apply to the product\n(and team) years down the road.\n\nThis talk will walk the audience through the process of learning a new\nproduct and development team, and allowing that information to guide the\ninformation architecture and tool selection process.\n\nTopics will include: - How do you learn a new product, and why is it\nessential to understand its market fit? - How do you learn about your\nusers - who are they, what are their primary pain points, and what do\nthey need most from docs? - How do you choose tools and workflows for\nbuilding your initial docs architecture? - How do you iterate on,\nimprove, and expand your docs, and harness contributors to do the same?\n",
