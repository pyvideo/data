  "abstract": "All humans require care. Writing and maintaining documentation is a form\nof care: good documentation can make us feel cared-for, and we, as\nwriters, can take satisfaction from empathizing with the end users of\nour work, and performing the caring work of documentation. By exploring\nand acknowledging the relationship between care, documentation, and\ntechnology, I argue, we can better understand and advocate for the value\nof our work. More so, understanding the importance of care allows us to\nwork better.\n\nThis talk illustrates how the work of documentation is care work, and\nexplores the ethical, philosophical and economic dimensions of care in\nrelationship to technical writing and documentation. I'll share findings\nand case studies from my own consulting practice, and explore patterns\n(and anti-patterns) I've observed around documentation and care. Then,\nto spur small group discussions, I'll share design principles for\ndocumentation as care.\n",
