This is the first time that the main PyCon conference is going to be outside of the US. Let's take this opportunity to showcase the Canadian Python community, and step up to the challenge as speakers and volunteers.\n    Strengthen the Canadian Python community by providing more opportunities for us to share knowledge and ideas, encourage support and education for speaking at conferences, and increase the visibility of developers, organizations, and companies within the community.\n    Host an annual Canadian PyCon conference, starting now - 2012!\n\nPyCon Canada is entirely run by volunteers who are passionate about\nthese goals. We hope to see you at the 2012 conference!\n",
