However, a significant challenge persists, with over 85% of Data Science Pilots failing to transition to the production stage.\n\nThis talk introduces Taipy, an open-source Python library for building web applications\u2019 front-end and back-end. It enables Data Scientists and Python Developers to create production-ready applications for end-users.\n\nIts simple syntax facilitates the creation of interactive, customizable, and multi-page dashboards without having to know about HTML or CSS. Taipy generates highly interactive interfaces, including charts and all sorts of widely used controls.\n\nAdditionally, Taipy is engineered to construct robust and tailored data-driven back-end applications. It models dataflows and orchestrates pipelines. Each pipeline execution is referred to as a scenario. Scenarios are stored, recorded, and actionable, enabling what-if analysis or KPI comparison.\n\nLately, Taipy provides the most suitable cloud tool to host, deploy, and share your Taipy applications easily. In addition, this platform provides the ability to manage, store, and maintain the various states of your backend.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
