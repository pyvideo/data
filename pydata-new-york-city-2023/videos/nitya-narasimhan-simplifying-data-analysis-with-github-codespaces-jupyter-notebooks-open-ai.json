  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nAs web developers, we create large quantities of data (e.g., from test reports and analytics) that require insights for iterative optimization. But how does a JavaScript developer begin their journey into data science? Enter GitHub Codespaces, GitHub Copilot and Open AI. In this talk, I'll share my journey into creating a consistent development and runtime environment with GitHub Codespaces and Jupyter Notebooks, then activating it with Open AI to support an interactive \"learn by exploring\" process that helped me (as a JavaScript developer) skill up on Python and data analysis techniques in actionable ways. I'll walk through a couple of motivating use cases, and demonstrate some projects related to competitive programming and data visualization to showcase these insights in action.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
