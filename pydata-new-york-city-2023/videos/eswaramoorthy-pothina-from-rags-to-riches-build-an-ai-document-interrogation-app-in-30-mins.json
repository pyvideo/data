  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nAs we descend from the peak of the hype cycle around Large Language Models (LLMs), chat-based document interrogation systems have emerged as a high value practical use case. The ability to ask natural language questions and get relevant answers from a large corpus of documents has the potential to fundamentally transform organizations and make institutional knowledge accessible.\n\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique to make foundational LLMs more powerful and accurate, and a leading way to implement a personal or company-level chat-based document interrogation system. In this talk, we\u2019ll understand RAG by creating a personal chat application. We\u2019ll use a new OSS project called Ragna that provides a friendly Python and REST API, designed for this particular case. We\u2019ll also demonstrate a web application that leverages the REST API built with Panel\u2013a powerful OSS Python application development framework.\n\nBy the end of this talk, you will have an understanding of the fundamental components that form a RAG model as well as exposure to open source tools that can help you or your organization explore and build on your own applications.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
