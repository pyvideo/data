Hosted by Erin Mikail Staples, lightning talks are fast-paced 5-minute talks by conference attendees.\n\nWant to know more about what to expect? Jessica Garson has written up some great advice on how to prepare and make the most of it! https://dev.to/jessicagarson/how-giving-lightning-talks-helped-me-gain-technical-confidence\u20132omm\n\nNo previous knowledge is expected; all levels are welcome to listen or present (limited slots available!).\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
