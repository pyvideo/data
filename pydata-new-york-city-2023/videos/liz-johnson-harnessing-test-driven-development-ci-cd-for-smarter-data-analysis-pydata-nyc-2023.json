We will live code examples of how to build unit tests during data analysis, how we can use fixtures to make basic validation on our ML engines, and once we create a script with the process end-to-end we will look at options for integration testing. Finally, we will set up a github pipeline that will run our tests in different phases in order to give us visibility into the accuracy of our scripts/engines.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
