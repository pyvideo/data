Traditional cloud tools often fall short in efficiently managing resources like GPUs, and the transition from local to cloud-based environments often involves cumbersome code changes and configurations. Additionally, the high costs and complex workflows associated with compute-intensive tasks are exacerbated by the scarcity and high demand for specialized computing resources. Covalent emerges as a Pythonic framework that addresses these multifaceted challenges. It simplifies the development of compute-intensive products, making them feel like a direct extension of one's local laptop rather than a complex cloud architectural exercise. Moreover, Covalent aids in cost reduction by efficiently managing and allocating resources, thereby optimizing the overall operational expenses. This tutorial will explore how Covalent is uniquely positioned to meet the computational and operational demands of a broad range of high-compute developments, including but not limited to Large Language Models and Generative AI, offering a more efficient and streamlined approach to cloud-based tasks.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
