Don't let it be your end point. Any software product deteriorates rapidly without disciplined testing. However, testing data pipelines is a hellish experience for new data developers. Unfortunately, there are somethings that are only learnt on the job. It is a crude reality that data pipeline testing is one of those fundamental skills that gets glossed over during the training of new data engineers. It can be so much more fun to learn about the latest and greatest python data processing library. But how can a new python data engineer transform a patchwork of scripts, into a well engineered data product? Testing is the cornerstone of any iterative development to reach acceptable confidence in the outputs of any data pipeline. This talk will help with an overview of modern data pipelines testing techniques in a visual and coherent game plan.\n\nWhy bother testing data pipelines? Billions of budget dollars regularly rely on the excellence of the data scientists, data engineers, and machine learning engineers behind the countless software data pipelines that inform critical business decisions.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
