  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nFor online publications and media sites, recommendation systems play an important role in engaging readers. At Chartbeat, we are actively developing a recommendation system that caters to billions of daily pageviews across thousands of global websites. While conventional discussions frequently highlight the data science and machine learning facets of the system, the cornerstone of a successful application is its system architecture. In this presentation, we will dissect our architectural decisions designed to meet high-performance requirements and share insights gleaned from our journey in scaling up the recommendation system.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
