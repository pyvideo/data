MMM plays a pivotal role in marketing strategy, enabling businesses to measure marketing effectiveness and optimize budget allocation across various channels. The presentation will offer an overview of both Bayesian and Frequentist approaches, comparing their principles and applications within the MMM context. We will present a real-world case, showcasing how these two models were used to deconstruct sales driven by several factors and generate actionable insights. Finally, we will share reflections and recommendations for marketers and data scientists regarding further exploration and adoption of different techniques in MMM, empowering businesses to make informed decisions and effectively allocate their marketing resources.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
