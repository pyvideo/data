The final approach of the solution is industry agnostic. We will walk through our thought framework for breaking down a business problem into LLM-able chunks, lay out the explored solutions and best performing method, compare local vs. at scale inference, and how we evaluated the unstructured LLM responses to prevent hallucination and ambiguity in getting structured response.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
