In times of crisis where demand exceeds its projected amount, system operators need to fall back on different methods to lower demand. One such method is Dynamic Pricing which incentivizes customers to lower their consumption by increasing electricity prices during those times. There are trials that test out this pricing model against a flat rate pricing model. This talk uses mathematics and statistical techniques applied in python to see the impact of dynamic pricing on consumption.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
