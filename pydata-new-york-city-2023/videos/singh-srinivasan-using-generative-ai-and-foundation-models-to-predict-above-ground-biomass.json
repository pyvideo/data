This is especially true in the remote sensing field where seasonal changes and differences between label characteristics makes difficult creating a common labeled dataset. With the emergence of self-supervised learning the amount and quality of labeled data can be relaxed but model performance is still of paramount importance. This is especially true for quantifying the sources and sinks of greenhouse gases that drive climate change. In this talk, we present how state of the art AI technologies such as generative AI and Foundation Models can be used to estimate Above Ground Biomass (AGBD) changes due to extraction of CO2 from the atmosphere by vegetation. We demonstrate how these tools can be used by companies with NetZero pledge to quantify, monitor, validate and report their offsetting methodologies and sustainability practices.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
