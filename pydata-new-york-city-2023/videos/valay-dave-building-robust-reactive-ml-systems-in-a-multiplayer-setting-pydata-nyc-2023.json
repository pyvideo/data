This talk delves into Metaflow's solutions to these challenges, spotlighting its event-driven patterns that streamline model training while leveraging infrastructure shared by multiple data-scientists/engineers. Through a hands-on demonstration, we'll showcase how Metaflow facilitates asynchronous training upon new data arrivals for finetuning a state-of-the-art LLM like LLaMAv2 (although the framework is general and widely applicable). Additionally, we'll highlight how multiple developers can seamlessly experiment with various models as new data becomes available.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
