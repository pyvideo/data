J.J. is now leading the Quarto project, a Jupyter-based scientific and technical publishing system. In this talk, J.J. will introduce Quarto Dashboards, an easy way to create production quality dashboards from Jupyter Notebooks. J.J. will also more broadly discuss Posit's recent work in the open source PyData ecosystem along with plans for significantly expanding that work in the future.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
