For instance, data professionals might require data from heavily regulated industries like healthcare and finance, and, in contrast, software developers might want to skip the tedious task of collecting images, text, and videos for a website. Luckily, both scenarios can now benefit from the same solution, Synthetic Data.\n\nSynthetic Data is artificially generated data created with machine learning models, algorithms, and simulations, and this workshop is designed to show you how to enter that synthetic world by teaching you how to create a full-stack tech product with five interrelated projects. These projects include reproducible data pipelines, a dashboard, machine learning models, a web interface, and a documentation site. So, if you want to enhance your data projects or find great assets to build a website with, come and spend 3 fun and knowledge-rich hours in this workshop.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
