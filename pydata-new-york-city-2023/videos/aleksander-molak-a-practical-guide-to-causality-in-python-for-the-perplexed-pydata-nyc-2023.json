  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nWith an average of 3.2 new papers published on Arxiv every day in 2022, causal inference has exploded in popularity, attracting large amount of talent and interest from top researchers and institutions including industry giants like Amazon or Microsoft.\n\nThere\u2019s a very good reason for this upsurge in popularity. In our contemporary data culture we got accustomed to thinking that traditional machine learning methods can provide us with answers to any interesting business or scientific questions.\n\nThis view turns out to be incorrect. Many interesting business and scientific questions are causal in their nature and traditional machine learning methods are not suitable to address them.\n\nIn this talk, dedicated to data scientists and machine learning engineers with at least 3 years of experience, we\u2019ll show why this is the case, we\u2019ll introduce the fundamental tools for causal thinking and show how to translate them into code.\n\nWe\u2019ll discuss a popular use case of churn prevention and demonstrate why only causal models should be used to solve it.\n\nAll in Python, repo included!\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
