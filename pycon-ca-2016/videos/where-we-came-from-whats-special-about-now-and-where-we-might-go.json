  "description": "Based on interviews with leading developers of Python and with Python,\nwe take a look at how the Python language specification and the\nreference implementation are developed. The subcommunity of core\ndevelopers not only produces a great programming language that's fun to\nuse, but sets the tone for a vibrant, productive, and inclusive\ncommunity of user-developers.\n\nStephen J Turnbull Bio\n----------------------\n\nKnown as the Unwelome Guest on several channels because he professes the\nDismal Science of Economics, Steve nonetheless has found a ray of light\namong the zero-profit theorems: open source software and the communities\nthat develop, support, and use it. He teaches in Japan, where he learned\nthe virtues of Unicode from living in an environment with 5 different\nencodings (and many nonstandard variants) in use for the same language.\nHe was introduced to Python development during the discussion of PEP 263\n(which appropriately enough allows you to be explicit about encoding of\nPython programs), when he was turned into a newt by none other than GvR\nfor the sin of misusing the word \"pythonic\". (It got better!) He mentors\nin GSoC for Systers & GNU Mailman, and spends what's left of his free\ntime fighting DMARC to make the Internet safe for mailing lists again.\nHe's also been know to write Emacs Lisp (ssh! it's a dirty secret!)\n",
