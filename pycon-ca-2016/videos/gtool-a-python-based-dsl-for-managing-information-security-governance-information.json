  "description": "Security professionals don't have great tools for managing their\ngovernance programs (audit, risk, system descriptions, etc.) and\ntypically need to buy very expensive tools or resort to using Excel\nspreadsheets. G.Tool is an opensource python based framework that uses\npyparsing to implement a user DSL and file ORM for building your\nsecurity governance tools without writing code.\n\nBen Sapiro Bio\n--------------\n\nI am the head of Security at Vision Critical (a SaaS company) and have\nworked in both infosec consulting and operations since graduated from\nb-school. I'm a regular contributor on the LiquidMatrix Podcast\n(whenever we get around to recording it) and helps run BSidesTO.\n\nRecently, I built an internal tool (in Python) at work and it went\nreasonably well to I decided so I decided to rebuild, from scratch, an\nopen source and generalized version of the tool to help security\nprofessionals manage different information processes from audit\nreporting to risk management and everything in between.\n\nI am not a professional developer but I've dabbled with Python for\nyears. This is my first serious release in Python. Prior to this I\nreleased an opensource tool called Binary Risk Analysis.\n",
