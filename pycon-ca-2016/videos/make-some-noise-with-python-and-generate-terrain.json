  "description": "We will explore how seemingly simple functions can be layered together\nto create complex and feature rich topological maps. Watch as each extra\nlayer introduces more interesting, diverse worlds which can be used as\nimages, in games, or as a playground for the curious.\n\nMichael McHugh Bio\n------------------\n\nIntroduced to Python a decade ago, I now work as a lead engineer at\nUrban Airship. Originally from Southern Ontario, I moved to Portland,\nOregon 4 years ago. I use half a dozen languages on a weekly basis, but\nPython has always been my go to for experimentation and productivity.\nOwner of untold hundreds of half finished projects, seeing how far I can\npush an idea is much more exciting to me than seeing something\ncompleted.\n",
