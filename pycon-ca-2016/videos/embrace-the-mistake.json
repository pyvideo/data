  "description": "Without mistakes, there is no knowledge. We must make wrong predictions\nto learn, and we must try the impossible to break out of our\ncomplacency. This talk will explore the key role mistakes play in our\nown minds, our attempts to build AIs, and our practice as programmers.\nWe are going to argue that mistakes are your best friend and offer some\nguidance on how to make more of them.\n\nMike C. Fletcher Bio\n--------------------\n\nMike Fletcher is a design epistemologist (someone who studies the\nformation of knowledge or belief) by training, currently running a small\nprogramming consultancy in Toronto.
