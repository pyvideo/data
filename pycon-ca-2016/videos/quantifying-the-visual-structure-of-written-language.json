  "description": "This talk details how a distributed application was used to\nalgorithmically compare pairs of Chinese characters for use in\npsycholinguistic research. By programmatically representing the\nstructure of Chinese characters, it is possible to quantify the\nsimilarity of two characters in the same way it is possible to quantify\nthe similarity of two English words by comparing their constituent\nletters.\n\nNick Anderegg Bio\n-----------------\n\nNick is an MSc student in Cognitive Psychology at Western University,\nwith a primary research area in reading, phonology, and computational\npsycholinguistics. He earned a BPhil degree in Linguistics and a BA\ndegree in Psychology from Penn State University. He's primarily\ninterested in understanding universal reading processes that speakers of\ndifferent languages have in common, and how cross-linguistic differences\nin writing systems and phonology interact with these processes.\n",
