MLDA exploits multilevel model hierarchies to improve sampling efficiency compared to standard methods, especially when working with high-dimensional problems where gradients are not available. We will present a step-by-step guide on how to use MLDA within PyMC3, go through its various features and also present some advanced use cases, e.g. employing multilevel PDE-based models written in FEniCS and using adaptive error correction to correct model bias between different levels.\n\n\nDiscourse Discussion\nhttps://discourse.pymc.io/t/the-mlda-multilevel-sampler-in-pymc3-by-tim-dodwell-mikkel-lykkegaard-and-grigorios-mingas/5982\n\n\n## Timestamps\n00:00 Introduction\n00:36 A three way plan of attack!\n03:21 Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification - Vanilla MCMC Starts with Bayes' Theorem\n06:13 Delayed Acceptance - Christen & Fox, 2005\n07:39 Multilevel Delayed Acceptance - Adpt 1 - Finite Subchains\n08:33 Multilevel Delayed Acceptance - Adpt 2 - Apply Recursively\n09:50 MLDA in PyMC3\n22:21 Correcting Coarse Models\n23:40 Coarse Model Bias\n25:01 Modelling the Bias\n26:41 Adaptive Error Model\n27:53 Example\n38:43 What we would like from you - Contacts\n\nSpeaker bio:\nProf. Tim Dodwell has a personal chair in Computational Mechanics at the University of Exeter, is the Romberg Visiting at Heidelberg in Scientific Computing and holds a 5 year Turing AI Fellowship at the Alan Turing Institute where he is also an academic lead.\n\n\n-Twitter: https://twitter.com/proftimdodwell\n-Website: https://www.datacentricengineering.co.uk/team.html\n\n\nMikkel Lykkegaard is a PhD student with the Data Centric Engineering Group and Centre for Water Systems (CWS) at University of Exeter.
