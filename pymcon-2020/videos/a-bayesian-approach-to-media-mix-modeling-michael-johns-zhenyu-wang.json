  "description": "Speakers: Michael Johns & Zhenyu Wang\n\nTitle: A Bayesian Approach to Media Mix Modeling\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/UznM_-_760Y\n\n\n\nEvent description:\nThis talk describes how we built a Bayesian Media Mix Model of new customer acquisition using PyMC. We will explain the statistical structure of the model in detail, with special attention to nonlinear functional transformations, discuss some of the technical challenges we tackled when building it in a Bayesian framework, and touch on how we use it in production to guide our marketing strategy.\n\n\nDiscourse Discussion\nhttps://discourse.pymc.io/t/a-bayesian-approach-to-media-mix-modeling-by-michael-johns-zhenyu-wang/6024\n\n\n## Outline\n- Marketing at HelloFresh\n- What is a Media Mixed Model?\n- Media Mixed Model: Structure & Function\n- Bayesian model building workflow\n- Model applications\n\n## Timestamps\n00:00 Introduction and outline of presentation\n01:16 Marketing at HelloFresh (funnels, conversion, channels)\n02:40 Measuring the effectiveness of marketing\n05:00 What is Media Mix Modelling?
