Knowledge-based and probabilistic models in chemistry using PyMC\n\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8n8XD-cB90\n\nEvent description: \nWe have used PyMC to formulate an explainable probabilistic model of chemical reactivity. This probabilistic model combines the intuitive concepts of high school chemistry with the computer\u2019s ability to store and reason about large datasets. We use our model in the lab, where it guides a robot chemist towards \"interesting\" experiments that might lead to the discovery of new reactions.\n\nDiscourse Discussion\nhttps://discourse.pymc.io/t/an-alcohol-what-are-the-chances-knowledge-based-and-probabilistic-models-in-chemistry-using-pymc3-by-hessam-mehr-dario-caramelli/6018\n\n## Timestamps\n00:00 Introduction Dario and Hessam\n00:26 Digitizing chemistry\n00:46 Automated synthesis\n01:10 Automated discovery\n02:50 Hardware\n03:19 Starting materials\n03:38 Reactivity assignment\n04:54 How to infer reactivity?\n05:58 Abstract properties\n07:03 Coming up with a plan for a model\n07:50 Algorithm: Mechanics\n09:31 Working with chemical structures\n10:05 Compound motifs\n11:27 Simulating discovery\n13:36 Algorithm: exploration\n15:31 Limitations and Growing pains\n15:45 Issues with performance\n17:15 Problem specific to solving this\n18:53 Acknowledgements\n\n## Note: help us add timestamps here\nhttps://github.com/pymc-devs/video-timestamps\n\nSpeaker bio:\nDario Caramelli is a research associate in the Cronin group at the University of Glasgow. His research involves building and programming of autonomous robots for reaction discovery as well as the development of algorithms for chemical space modelling and data processing. Dario obtained a Master degree in Organic chemistry in Rome (2015) and a PhD in the Cronin group (2019).\n\n-Twitter: https://twitter.com/dariocaramelli \n-LinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/in/dario-caramelli-705250150\n\nHessam Mehr is a research associate in the Cronin group at the University of Glasgow\u2019s School of Chemistry. He works with an interdisciplinary group of scientists and engineers to build robots and teach them how to do chemistry. Since he joined the group in 2018, Hessam\u2019s main focus has been the integration of probabilistic reasoning with chemical robotics and discovery.\n\n-Twitter: https://twitter.com/hessammehr\n-GitHub: https://github.com/hessammehr\n-Website: https://hessammehr.github.io/\n\nPart of PyMCon2020. \nMore details at http://www.pymcon.com  \n\n#bayesian #statistics #probabilistic",
