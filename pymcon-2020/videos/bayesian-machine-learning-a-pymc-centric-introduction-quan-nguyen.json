  "description": "Speaker: Quan Nguyen\n\nTitle:  Bayesian Machine Learning: A PyMC-Centric Introduction\n\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7U8jhKtdBA\n\n\n\nEvent description:\nAt the heart of any machine learning (ML) problem is the identification of models that explain the data well, where learning about the model parameters, treated as random variables, is integral. Bayes\u2019 theorem, and in general Bayesian learning, offers a principled framework to update one\u2019s beliefs about an unknown quantity; Bayesian methods therefore play an important role in many aspects of ML. This introductory talk aims to highlight some of the most prominent areas in Bayesian ML from the perspective of statisticians and analysts, drawing parallels between these areas and common problems that Bayesian statisticians work on.\n\n\nDiscourse Discussion\nhttps://discourse.pymc.io/t/bayesian-machine-learning-a-pymc-centric-introduction-by-quan-nguyen/5985\n\n\n## Timestamps\n00:00 Introduction by Quan\n00:58 Agenda of the talk\n01:39 Part 1: Bayesian Modeling \n02:43 The prior distribution\n03:55 The likelihood function\n05:07 Applying Bayes' theorem to make an inference\n05:48 Using sampling techniques to approximate the integral\n06:55 The posterior distribution\n09:58 Applying Gaussian Processes (GP) to model a latent function\n14:18 Defining hyperparameters of a GP model\n16:15 What makes these Bayesian techniques unique to machine learning\n17:07 Example: Linear regression using Bayesian techniques\n20:52 Applying the Bayesian framework to neural networks\n22:31 Part 2: Bayesian Decision Theory\n23:50 Example: The price is right\n24:57 The utility function\n26:34 Visualizing the optimal decision\n28:05 Example: The multi-armed bandit problem\n31:39 The Bayesian optimal policy\n33:03 The Upper-Confidence Bound (UCB) policy\n34:24 The Thompson Sampling policy\n36:56 Bayesian optimization: A framework to minimize costs\n39:02 Applying Gaussian Processes (GP) to help identify the function maximizer\n40:54 Using the posterior belief to approximate Bayesian optimal policies\n42:20 Distribution of the true maximizer\n44:28 Other Bayesian decision-making problems\n46:27 Conclusion\n\n\n## Note: help us add timestamps here\nhttps://github.com/pymc-devs/video-timestamps\n\n\nSpeaker bio:\nQuan is a Bayesian statistics enthusiast (and a programmer at heart).
