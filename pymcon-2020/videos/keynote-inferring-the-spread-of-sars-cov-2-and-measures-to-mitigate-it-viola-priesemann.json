I will present approaches to infer the effectiveness of interventions, and models to explore their potential. This talk will be interesting for anyone wanting to understand the current and potential future dynamics of COVID-19.\n\n\nDiscourse Discussion\nhttps://discourse.pymc.io/t/keynote-inferring-the-spread-of-sars-cov-2-and-measures-to-mitigate-it-by-viola-priesemann/6179\n\n## Timestamps\n00:00 Introductory words by Viola\n00:48 The daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases\n01:39 The agenda of the talk\n02:19 Infection chains and the reproduction number R\n04:17 Subsampling theory\n05:41 Part 1: Effectiveness of interventions\n05:51 Reported infections with SARS-CoV-2 in Germany\n06:46 Project disease dynamics to a model\n07:25 SIR model to infer the reproduction number\n09:10 Details of the model\n10:28 Drawing predictions from the model\n12:19 Effective growth rate\n13:18 Conclusion from the first COVID wave\n15:46 Date of reporting vs date of putative symptom onset\n17:41 A study on the effectiveness of interventions\n18:37 Effectiveness of each intervention\n20:33 School vs university closure\n21:31 Part 2: Controlled dynamics due to test-trace-isolate (TTI)\n22:32 TTI contributes to containing the spread\n23:32 3 testing strategies: random, symptom-driven, testing of contacts\n24:12 Limitations of TTI\n26:02 TTI contributes almost 50% of the mitigation\n29:22 Capacity limit of TTI\n30:12 Part 3: TTI capacity presents a tipping point\n31:35 Factors that destabilize TTI\n33:35 The TTI tipping point\n35:00 Reported cases vs deaths - not a testing bias\n37:58 What about the future?\n38:14 1. Early intervention reduces case numbers\n39:57 2. Lock-down allows stabilizing the situation again\n40:54 3. Break the chain early\n41:37 4. The coming months\n45:12 Summary\n46:12 Next-time: Infogenesis - Neural network self-organization for information processing\n46:53 Thank you!\n\n\n## Note: help us add timestamps here\nhttps://github.com/pymc-devs/video-timestamps\n\n\nSpeaker bio:\nViola heads a research team at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization. She investigates the self-organization of spreading dynamics in the brain to understand the emergence of living computation. With the outbreak of COVID-19, she adapted these mathematical approaches to infer and predict the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and to investigate mitigation strategies. Viola is board member of the Campus Institute for Data Science and Fellow of the Schiemann Kolleg.\n\n\nSpeaker info:\n-Twitter: https://twitter.com/violapriesemann\n-GitHub: https://github.com/vpriesem\n-Website: http://www.viola-priesemann.de/\n\n\nPart of PyMCon2020. \nMore details at http://www.pymcon.com  \n\n\n#bayesian #statistics #covid19",
