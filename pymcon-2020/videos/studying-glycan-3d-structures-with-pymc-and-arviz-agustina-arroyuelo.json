They are very useful for the statistical modelling of, time, wind directions, bond angles between atoms or even swimming pattern in fish. In this talk, I will present an introduction to circular variables, mostly related to my work in ArviZ during the last GSoC and I will offer a glimpse on how to use PyMC and ArviZ to explore biomolecules 3D shapes.\n\n\nDiscourse Discussion\nhttps://discourse.pymc.io/t/studying-glycan-3d-structures-with-pymc3-and-arviz-by-agustina-arroyuelo/5981\n\n\n## Timestamps\n00:00 Start of event\n01:40 Outline/Flow of the presentation\n02:20 Glycans\n04:30 Torsion Angles\n05:29 Circular variables\n07:02 Von Mises distribution\n08:20 Energy and Boltzmann distribution\n11:01 Bayesian model for exploring glycan\n18:10 Contact Us\n\nSpeaker bio:\nAgustina is a PhD candidate in Biology. In her research, she applies Bayesian statistics to biomolecular structure determination and validation, i.e. finding the 3-dimensional shape of biomolecules and evaluating if that shape is a good model. She enjoys contributing to open source software. She has participated in the Google Summer of Code program with PyMC and ArviZ and she was recently incorporated to ArviZ core developers team.\n\n\nSpeaker info: \n-GitHub: https://github.com/agustinaarroyuelo \n-Twitter: https://twitter.com/agustinaarroyu1\n-LinkedIn: https://ar.linkedin.com/in/agustina-arroyuelo\n\n\nPart of PyMCon2020. \nMore details at http://www.pymcon.com  \n\n\n#bayesian #PyMC #ArviZ",
