  "description": "Speaker: Nicoleta Sp\u00eenu\n\nTitle: Estimating the Causal Network of Developmental Neurotoxicants using PyMC  \n\n\n\nEvent description:\nThere is a vital need for alternative methods to animal testing to assess compounds for their potency of inducing developmental neurotoxicity such as learning disabilities in children. However, data are often limited and complex in structure. Therefore, Bayesian approaches are perfect to unravel their meaning and create predictive models. In this talk, I will showcase a multilevel probabilistic model and outline how to deal with unbalanced, correlated and missing values. This presentation will be of interest for those willing to learn multilevel modelling in PyMC, how to deal with missing values for both predictors and outcomes of data matrices, and their application to a real problem in toxicology.\n\n\nDiscourse Discussion\nhttps://discourse.pymc.io/t/estimating-the-causal-network-of-developmental-neurotoxicants-using-pymc3-by-nicoleta-spinu/6027\n\n\n## Timestamps\n- 0:00 Start of event\n- x:xx \n- x:xx\n\n\n## Note: help us add timestamps here\nhttps://github.com/pymc-devs/video-timestamps\n\n\nSpeaker bio:\nNicoleta Sp\u00eenu is a PhD candidate in Computational Toxicology with a background in pharmaceutical sciences and regulatory affairs looking to have her own impact on the protection of human health while promoting animal welfare (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement of animal testing; \u201cthe 3Rs\u201d). Research interests include the science of network and causal inference, computational modelling of chemical toxicity, and regulatory toxicology and policy making.\n\nSpeaker info: \n-Twitter: https://twitter.com/nicospinu\n-LinkedIn: https://uk.linkedin.com/in/nicoleta-spinu\n\nPart of PyMCon2020. \nMore details at http://www.pymcon.com  \n\n#bayesian #probabilistic #PyMC",
