In this talk, I will discuss how to improve our understanding of massive galaxy formation by combining the spectro-photometric observations of the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes for strong gravitationally lensed galaxies. In particular, a multi-level regression model is built that can fit all multi-wavelength data for a range of instruments within a hierarchical Bayesian framework to constrain the properties of the stellar populations. The details of how this model is implemented using PyMC, as well as the estimates of the posteriors of all parameters of interest and nuisance parameters will be highlighted.\n\nDiscourse Discussion\nhttps://discourse.pymc.io/t/a-novel-bayesian-model-to-fit-spectrophotometric-data-of-hubble-and-spitzer-space-telescopes-by-mo-akhshik/6026\n\n## Timestamps\n00:00 Start of event\n02:03 Observable Astronomy:  Grism Spectroscopy\n03:42 Understanding Quiescent galaxies:  How do they form so quickly?\n05:35 Physical Model\n08:16 Build the model - spectroscopy\n11:27 Build the model - HST photometry\n12:14 Build the model - Spitzer photometry\n12:52 Build the model - Nuisance Parameters\n20:50 Test prior using mock data\n30:00 Summary\n\n## Note: help us add timestamps here\nhttps://github.com/pymc-devs/video-timestamps\n\nSpeaker bio:\nMo is a grad student of (astro)physics by day, a matheux and a Bayesian enthusiast all along.
