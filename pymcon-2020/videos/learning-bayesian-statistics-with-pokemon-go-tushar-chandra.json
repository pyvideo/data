The exact appearance rates are unknown. But by using Bayesian inference and PyMC, we can model different species\u2019 shiny rates. In this beginner-level tutorial, we will introduce fundamental principles at the heart of Bayesian modeling; then we will apply them to develop PyMC models that can answer questions about Pokemon GO.\n\n\nDiscourse Discussion\nhttps://discourse.pymc.io/t/learning-bayesian-statistics-with-pokemon-go-by-tushar-chandra/6020\n\n\n## Timestamps\n- 0:00 Start of event\n- x:xx \n- x:xx\n\n\n## Note: help us add timestamps here\nhttps://github.com/pymc-devs/video-timestamps\n\n\nSpeaker bio:\nTushar is a senior data scientist at Nielsen Global Media in Chicago. At Nielsen, he works on developing Bayesian models for next-generation audience measurement. He loves cats (living with two, Luna and Ruby), chai, and college football. This is his first conference talk!\n\n\nSpeaker info:\n-GitHub: https://github.com/tuchandra\n-Twitter: https://twitter.com/threeshar\n-Website: https://tusharc.dev/\n\n\nPart of PyMCon2020. \nMore details at http://www.pymcon.com  \n\n\n#bayesian #statistics #PyMC",
