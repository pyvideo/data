  "description": "Speaker: Sayam Kumar\n\nTitle:  Demystifying Variational Inference\n\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrudJ-dgfOw\n\n\n\nEvent description:\nWhat will you do if MCMC is taking too long to sample? Also what if the dataset is huge? Is there any other cost-effective method for finding the posterior that can save us and potentially produce similar results? Well, you have come to the right place. In this talk, I will explain the intuition and maths behind Variational Inference, the algorithms capturing the amount of correlation, out of the box implementations that we can use, and ultimately diagnosing the model to fit our use case.\n\n\nDiscourse Discussion\nhttps://discourse.pymc.io/t/demystifying-variational-inference-by-sayam-kumar/6022\n\n\n## Timestamps\n- 0:00 Start of event\n- x:xx \n- x:xx\n\n\n## Note: help us add timestamps here\nhttps://github.com/pymc-devs/video-timestamps\n\n\nSpeaker bio:\nSayam Kumar is a Computer Science undergraduate student at IIIT Sri City, India. He loves to travel and study maths in his free time. He also finds Bayesian statistics super awesome. He was a Google Summer of Code student with NumFOCUS community and contributed towards adding Variational Inference methods to PyMC.\n\n\nSpeaker info: \n-Twitter: https://twitter.com/sayamkumar753 \n-GitHub:  https://github.com/Sayam753\n-LinkedIn: https://www.codingpaths.com/\n\n\nPart of PyMCon2020. \nMore details at http://www.pymcon.com  \n\n\n#bayesian #statistics",
