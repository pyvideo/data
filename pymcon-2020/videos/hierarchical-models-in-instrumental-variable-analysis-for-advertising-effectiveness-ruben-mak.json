  "description": "Speaker: Ruben Mak\n\nTitle: Using hierarchical models in instrumental variable analysis for advertising effectiveness\n\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeAJofHfUFk\n\n\n\nEvent description:\nDue to unobserved confounders, users are often exposed to too many repetitive ads. We will show how we use instrumental variable analysis to prove this is ineffective for advertisers. The focus of the talk will be choosing the model assumptions and how to implement them in PyMC. Finally, we show how hierarchical modeling can be used to combine these models.\n\n\nDiscourse Discussion\nhttps://discourse.pymc.io/t/using-hierarchical-models-in-instrumental-variable-analysis-for-advertising-effectiveness-by-ruben-mak/6021\n\n\n## Timestamps\n- 0:00 Start of event\n- x:xx \n- x:xx\n\n\n## Note: help us add timestamps here\nhttps://github.com/pymc-devs/video-timestamps\n\n\nSpeaker bio:\nBack in 2012, Ruben introduced data science at Greenhouse, a digital advertising agency in the Netherlands. He is currently principal data scientist and cluster lead. He\u2019s given several talks at PyData conferences and is one of the founders of PyData Eindhoven.\n\n\nSpeaker info:\n-GitHub: https://github.com/rubenmak\n-LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/today/author/rubenmak\n\n\nPart of PyMCon2020. \nMore details at http://www.pymcon.com  \n\n\n#bayesian #PyMC",
