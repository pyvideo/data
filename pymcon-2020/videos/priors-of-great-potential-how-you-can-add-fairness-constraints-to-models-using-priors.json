He started a few open source packages (whatlies, scikit-lego, clumper and evol) and is also known as co-founding chair of PyData Amsterdam. He currently works at Rasa as a Research Advocate where he tries to make NLP algorithms more accessible.\n\n-Twitter: https://twitter.com/fishnets88\n-GitHub: https://github.com/koaning\n-Website: https://pymc-devs.github.io/pymcon/koaning.io/calmcode.io\n\nMatthijs Brouns is a data scientist, active in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. His current work involves training junior data scientists at Xccelerated.io. This means he divides his time between building new training materials and exercises, giving live trainings and acting as a sparring partner for the Xccelerators at their partner firms, as well as doing some consulting work on the side\nHe spent a fair amount of time contributing to our open scientific computing ecosystem through various means. He maintains open source packages (scikit-lego, seers) as well as co-chair the PyData Amsterdam conference and meetup and vice-chair the PyData Global conference.\nIn his spare time, he likes to go mountain biking, bouldering, do some woodworking or go scuba diving.\n\n-GitHub: https://github.com/mbrouns\n-Twitter: https://twitter.com/MatthijsBrs\n-LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mbrouns/\n\nPart of PyMCon2020. \nMore details at http://www.pymcon.com  \n\n#bayesian #PyMC #priors",
