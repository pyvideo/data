  "description": "Speaker: Ivan Yashchuk\nTitle: Including partial differential equations in your PyMC model\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FC1umbf67o\n\nEvent description:\nThis tutorial will demonstrate use of PyMC for PDE-based inverse problems. We will infer parameters of a simple continuum mechanics model but the demonstrated tools can be readily applied to other complex PDE-based models.\n\nDiscourse Discussion\nhttps://discourse.pymc.io/t/including-partial-differential-equations-in-your-pymc3-model-by-ivan-yashchuk/6016\n\n## Timestamps\n- 0:00 Start of event\n- x:xx \n- x:xx\n\n## Note: help us add timestamps here\nhttps://github.com/pymc-devs/video-timestamps\n\nSpeaker bio:\nIvan Yashchuk has 3 years\u2019 experience in computational mechanics and scientific computing with occasional contributions to OSS projects. He received his M.Sc. in Computational Mechanics from Aalto University, Finland and is currently doing PhD research in Probabilistic Machine Learning group at Aalto.\n\nSpeaker info:\n-Twitter: https://mobile.twitter.com/IvanYashchuk\n-Website: https://ivanyashchuk.github.io/page/about/\n-LinkedIn: https://fi.linkedin.com/in/ivanyashchuk \n\nPart of PyMCon2020. \nMore details at http://www.pymcon.com  \n\n#bayesian #PyMC",
