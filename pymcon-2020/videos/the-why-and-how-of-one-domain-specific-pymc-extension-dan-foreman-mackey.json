  "description": "Speaker: Dan Foreman-Mackey\nTitle: The why and how of one domain-specific PyMC extension\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESyo2eeo-UM\n\nEvent description:\nIn this talk I will describe some of the unique challenges encountered in probabilistic modeling for astrophysics and some approaches taken to overcome these obstacles. In particular, I will discuss the motivation for and development of the domain-specific exoplanet package. This library implements a suite of custom Theano ops to evaluate astronomy-specific functions and their gradients, custom PyMC distributions for physically-motivated reparameterizations, and functions to help astronomers port existing habits to the PyMC ecosystem. exoplanet also includes an implementation of scalable Gaussian Process regression in one dimension that is generally applicable beyond astrophysics. Besides these technical details, I will also discuss some of the barriers that exist for domain scientists who are new to PyMC, and some proposals for lowering these barriers.\n\nDiscourse Discussion\nhttps://discourse.pymc.io/t/the-why-and-how-of-one-domain-specific-pymc3-extension-by-dan-foreman-mackey/5983\n\n## Timestamps\n- 0:00 Start of event\n- x:xx \n- x:xx\n\n\n## Note: help us add timestamps here\nhttps://github.com/pymc-devs/video-timestamps\n\n\nSpeaker bio:\nDan is an Associate Research Scientist at the Flatiron Institute\u2019s Center for Computational Astrophysics studying the application of probabilistic data analysis techniques to solve fundamental problems in astrophysics.\n\n\nSpeaker info: \n-GitHub: https://github.com/dfm\n-Twitter: https://twitter.com/exoplaneteer\n-Website: https://dfm.io/\n-LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-foreman-mackey\n\n\nPart of PyMCon2020. \nMore details at http://www.pymcon.com  \n\n\n#bayesian #PyMC #probabilistic",
