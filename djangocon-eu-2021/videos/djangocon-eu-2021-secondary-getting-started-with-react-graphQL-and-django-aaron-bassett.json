  "description": "\n\nWhat is GraphQL? When would I use it instead of DRF? How does it work with my models? In this session, we'll answer all these questions and more as we walk through a working example of a React, GraphQL, and Django application.\n\nWhen I first heard of GraphQL, I had a lot of questions. How is GraphQL different from REST? What're the benefits? When would I use it instead of DRF (Django Rest Framework)? Can I use it with my existing Django models? What about my views? My permissions? Is it difficult to integrate with my frontend?\n\nREST has served us well for more than twenty years; of course, I would be wary of any technology which requires a total paradigm shift. In this session, I will answer those questions and hopefully alleviate any apprehension about trying GraphQL.\n\nWe'll look at a working example of an RGD stack, showing how you can continue to use all the power of your Django backend while rendering and querying your data in React via GraphQL.",
