  "description": "We've been told to stop writing objects. We've been told to write more\nobjects.\n\nIn this talk, we cover the Python datamodel, when to begin writing\nobjects, what methods to start with that leverage the Python data model,\nand how to use the \"magic\" methods of Python. This talk assumes you know\na few of the basic builtin data structures of Python (dicts) and have at\nleast passing familiarity with operators (+, -, \\* , /, in, etc...)\n\nWhich should we be doing? When? How?\n",
