In particular, the focus is on data plumbing and on the practice of going from prototype to production.\n\nThis talk discusses the process of building data pipelines, e.g. extraction, cleaning, integration, pre-processing of data, in general all the steps that are necessary to prepare your data for your data-driven product. In particular, the focus is on data plumbing and on the practice of going from prototype to production.\n\nStarting from some common anti-patterns, we'll highlight the need for a workflow manager for any non-trivial project.\n\nWe'll discuss the case for Luigi as an interesting option to consider, and we'll consider where it fits in the bigger picture of deploying a data product.\n\nSlides available here: https://speakerdeck.com/marcobonzanini/building-data-pipelines-in-python-pydata-london-2016",
