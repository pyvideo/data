  "description": "In this talk, we will explore the process of upgrading a large codebase from Pydantic V1 to V2, focusing on practical steps, challenges, and strategies involved.\nWe will cover how to manage breaking changes, optimise the migration process, and ensure backward compatibility with minimal disruption to the existing system.\nKey focus areas will include refactoring, testing strategies, and performance improvements in Pydantic V2.\nBy the end of the session, you'll gain actionable insights and best practices to manage smooth migrations in complex codebases, ensuring a successful transition to the latest version of core libraries like Pydantic.\n\n--\nPython España: https://es.python.org/\nPython Vigo: https://www.python-vigo.es/\nBlueSky: @es.pycon.org\nTwitter/X: @PyConES",
