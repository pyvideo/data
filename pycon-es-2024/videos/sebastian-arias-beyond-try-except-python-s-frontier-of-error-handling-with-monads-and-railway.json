  "description": "Python developers often grapple with the LBYL and EAFP approaches to exception handling. As codebases evolve, the demand for effective error-handling strategies intensifies. This presentation introduces a paradigm-shifting approach to exception handling in Python by leveraging monads, specifically the Results Library, and embracing the Railway-Driven Development methodology – a functional programming concept known for providing a consistent and composable structure.\n\nDemonstrating this approach through code examples, we'll showcase how integrating this monadic approach with Python features like pattern matching simplifies error management, elevating code readability, maintainability, and reliability.\n\nBy the end, attendees will possess a thorough understanding of monadic error handling and the Railway-Driven Development methodology. This knowledge empowers developers to make informed decisions, fostering more robust and maintainable Python code within the functional programming paradigm.\n \nPython España: https://es.python.org/\nPython Vigo: https://www.python-vigo.es/\nBlueSky: @es.pycon.org\nTwitter/X: @PyConES",
