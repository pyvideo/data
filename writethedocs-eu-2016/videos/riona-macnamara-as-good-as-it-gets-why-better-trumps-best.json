  "description": "What are the characteristics of a great documentation set? Completeness?\nAccuracy? Style? Format? No! A great documentation set is one that meets\nits objectives, and sometimes the barrier to greatness is not\ndedication, skill, or passion, but a reluctance to let things go. Every\ndocument we publish should reach a certain quality threshold - but that\nthreshold varies depending on its audience, the maturity of the project,\nand the overall project goals. What matters is not that docs are\nperfect, but that they are *good enough*.\n\nBut how to determine if a doc is \"good enough\"? This talk will cover how\nto:\n\n-  Define document quality\n-  Establish an appropriate quality bar for a document or doc set\n-  Determine if a document meets that bar.\n\nWe're all overloaded. We're all stretched for time. Every hour we spend\nmaking a doc better than it needs to be is an hour stolen from other\nprojects where we could have more impact. Choosing \"good enough\" doesn't\nmean we're lowering our standards; it means we're choosing *appropriate*\nstandards and prioritizing correctly. Don't let the perfect be the enemy\nof the good.\n",
