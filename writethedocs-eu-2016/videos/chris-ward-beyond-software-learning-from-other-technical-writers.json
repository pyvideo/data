  "abstract": "Outside of my technical writing work for software projects I have been\ncreating a board game. A board game also requires mechanics to function\nand players to clearly understand how these mechanics work to use and\nappreciate fully.\n\nAs part of my research for writing game manuals I looked at manuals for\nfurniture, electronics, and cars to see how they explain to users how to\nsetup and use their products.\n\nIn this presentation I will look at how the technical writing skills of\ndifferent industries can learn from each other.\n\nThis will include:\n\n-  Game Manuals and tutorials\n-  Assembly instructions (e.g. those wonderful Ikea inserts)\n-  Service Manuals for electronics\n\nAnd as part of looking at these case studies, the presentation will\ncover:\n\n-  Iconography vs Text\n-  The limitations of updating print manuals\n-  Reducing language and cultural colloquialisms\n-  Identifying what needs to be said and what doesn't\n\nAnd by the end of the presentation I hope that everyone will have learnt\na lot from each other and realize that we're all trying to achieve the\nsame thing(s).\n",
