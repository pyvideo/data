  "abstract": "Do you know what the support agents are doing over in their corner? It\u2019s\nnot all cat gifs and angry users. There\u2019s real value to be found in\nworking together with your support team. They are a direct line to your\nusers!\n\nIt can definitely be difficult to bridge this gap between disciplines,\nbut your goals are 100% the same: help the customer do The Thing.\nBecause support literally spends all day talking to customers, they have\na ton of amazing data about the effectiveness of documentation, and the\ntasks customers are trying to accomplish.\n\nBuilding a better relationship with your support team will help you\nbuild a better relationship with your users. I\u2019ve seen first hand how\ncoordination drives a well executed user experience all the way from\nself service to hands- on support. Work together better and see tangible\nresults in your user happiness!\n\nIn this talk, I\u2019ll show you: \u00b7 the value of having support and technical\nwriting aligned \u00b7 how to break down the silos between teams and work\neffectively together \u00b7 how to access and use the glorious data that\nsupport is already collecting \u00b7 the metrics that matter for support-led\nuser assistance\n",
