  "description": "Interaction between incorporated software-systems is often realized via\napplication programming interfaces (APIs). The API-documentation\nexplains how to use the API. If it misses important information, serious\nmisunderstandings between the API\u2019s consumer and provider can be the\nconsequence.\n\nI my talk I will show how meaningful names in the source-code can help\nfinding gaps in the API-documentation. My findings base on my\nproject-experiences and a cross-sectional study of a corpus of more than\n186.000 web service- operations. I would like to share the 20\ndescription-patterns for API- documentation I found so far. They provide\ndetailed recommendations description of specific operations. The talk\ncloses with a comparison of classical \u201eswagger-like\u201c API-documentation\nwith the presented approach.\n",
