  "abstract": "The Write the Docs community has been growing over the past few years,\nand we're incredibly happy to see the wide diversity that it contains.\nIn the beginning of 2016 we put together a survey to investigate how\npeople are doing their jobs, what the current status is of\ndocumentation, and what the future will bring. We're calling this effort\n\"Poll the Docs\".\n\nThanks to the 100+ participants who already filled it out and shared\ntheir experiences and thoughts about documentation. We will be able to\nshare insights about the demographic background of the community, how\ndocumentarians usually start working in this field and give an overview\nof the most supported practises, tools, languages and skills.\n",
