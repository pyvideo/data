  "description": "Operations tech writing encompasses both hardware and software, and the\nchallenge is coming up to speed on the intersecting parts of these 2\ndisciplines. More than any other type of tech writing, operations TW is\nthe art of supporting highly technical, cross-functional teams. Most\ncompanies create super secret, bleeding edge technologies to make their\ndata centers efficient, powerful, reliable, economical, and, hopefully,\ngreen. There are few opportunities to gain background info to bring\nyourself up to speed and feel confident about your technical prowess.\n\nThis is a little talked about area of TW that's growing in importance\nand demand. At Google, it's been difficult to find writers qualified to\nhandle the cross-functional complexities/hit the ground running, and the\nramp up is steep. I'll address the demands of working in this\nchallenging but fascinating field, as well as some cultural perks such\nas working with physical engineers (mechanical, electrical,\nmanufacturing), travel, and developing one's photography skills -- and\nsaying goodbye to capturing screenshots.\n",
