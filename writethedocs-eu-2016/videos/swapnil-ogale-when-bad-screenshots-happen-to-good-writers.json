  "abstract": "You have your content moving at a swift pace, your documents are getting\nreviewed in a timely fashion (surprise!) and you are nicely heading\ntowards your release milestone. The only thing missing are some key\nscreenshots that you need to put in before you publish your\ndocumentation. What you get instead are some hideous images posing as\nscreenshots, that were captured randomly, bears no resemblance to your\ninstructions and would make no sense whatsoever to the end user.\n\nWe (documentarians) know how this usually pans out.\n\nThis talk is about when bad screenshots happen to good writers.\n\nIn my presentation, I will talk about:\n\n1. Why do we need screenshots and who provides these screenshots?\n2. What is the outcome of bad screenshots?\n3. Can we do something about acquiring screenshots in a standard manner?\n4. What are some best practices everyone can use for screenshots?\n5. Some examples of really useless screenshots.\n",
