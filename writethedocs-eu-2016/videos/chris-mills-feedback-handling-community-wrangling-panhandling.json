  "abstract": "Feedback is a big deal. As tech writers we want to receive adultation\nwhen the docs rock, or constructive criticism when there is cleanup\nrequired. Or EVEN BETTER, we want the engineers/community members/reddit\nreaders/clowns giving the feedback to come on board and help fix the\nproblems.\n\nBut. Actually tweaking the signal to noise ratio to something useful is\nreally difficult. Especially when you are curating a site as enormous as\nMDN, the content of which is open licensed, multilingual, and open for\npublic editing.\n\nIn this talk, MDN writer Chris Mills discusses topics such as how to\nchoose the right feedback mechanism(s) for your situation, how to stem\nthe torrent and get the right kind of feedback and contributions\n(actually useful), effective begging, stealing and borrowing, and how to\nbalance being firm and keeping control of your product with being\ndiplomatic and being able to sleep at night.\n",
