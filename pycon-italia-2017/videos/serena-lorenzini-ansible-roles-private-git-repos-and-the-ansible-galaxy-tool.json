  "description": "Ansible is a python tool that automates the management of an IT\ninfrastructure. It is easy to learn but rushing to use it with a limited\nknowledge of its best practices leads to not reusable code.\n\nCreating reusable Ansible roles is a strongly encouraged practice, in\nfact there is a tool designed just for this purpose: Ansible Galaxy. It\ncomes bundled with Ansible and its purpose is to download roles from the\nGalaxy hub and other sources.\n\nThis talk wants to show how we manage our Ansible roles and their\ndependencies in a consistent way by means of Ansible Galaxy. It will\nalso offer an overview of how Ansible roles can be tested.\n",
