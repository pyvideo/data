  "description": "Software architecture is often overlooked: pushed by deadlines and\nhurry, we tend to make our applications a giant ball of mud. Here is\nwhere the unix philosophy comes to help.\n\nIn this talk I will give an overview of the unix philosophy and I will\nexplain how I have applied it to django development for the\n`OpenWISP <http://openwisp.org>`__ and `NetJSON <http://netjson.org/>`__\nprojects (a set of software modules and standard formats that can be\nused to `deploy wireless networks and implement a public wifi\nservice <http://openwisp.org/whatis.html>`__) with encouraging results.\nIn this talk I will cover the benefits and the downside of such\napproach, showing example implementations that are being tested in the\nreal world.\n\n`Slides are available on\nslideshare <https://www.slideshare.net/FedericoCapoano/applying-the-unix-%20philosophy-to-django-projects-a-report-from-the-real-world>`__.\n",
