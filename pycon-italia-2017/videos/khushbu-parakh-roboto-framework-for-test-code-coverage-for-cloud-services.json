  "description": "Test case design is an important phase of software testing life cycle\nwhere test cases are identified. Designing test cases for cloud\nsolutions requires a different approach from traditional application\noriented testing. The quality which is multidimensional will include\nmore attributes like network resiliency, fault recovery, reliability and\navailability when it comes to cloud-based solutions. If such aspects\nwhen not encompassed through test development framework, it will lead to\nhigh chances of defect leakage in production in an agile mode of\ndelivery. We propose a strategy to design the test cases which traverse\nacross different levels of testing to find gaps using the Roboto\nframework with Python. The solution provides the teams and the product\nowners to get a picture of what is getting tested and how much of\ncoverage is done. The data can be used in team release discussions to\nbuild confidence in the tests that gets executed as part of that\nrelease. https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework Testing\nperformed for features in a product is diverse and can be widely\ncategorized into functional, non-functional like reliability, fault\ninjections etc. Though developing test cases for functional changes is\nachievable, arriving at test cases for non-functional requirements is\nchallenging in the given two-week sprint cycle of agile, and so leads to\ndefect leakage. Some vital modules in a project would have been running\nin production for years and would have different sets of teams working\nat different periods. Quantifying test code coverage and quality only by\na number of test cases per feature does not suffice as testing is\nmultidimensional and has to span across different levels. Measuring and\nimproving the test code coverage is the challenge generally faced by\nproduct teams.\n",
