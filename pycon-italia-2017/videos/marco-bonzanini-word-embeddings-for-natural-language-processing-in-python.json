  "description": "Word embeddings are a family of Natural Language Processing (NLP)\nalgorithms where words are mapped to vectors in low-dimensional space.\nThe interest around word embeddings has been on the rise in the past few\nyears, because these techniques have been driving important improvements\nin many NLP applications like text classification, sentiment analysis or\nmachine translation.\n\nIn this talk we\u2019ll describe the intuitions behind this family of\nalgorithms, we\u2019ll explore some of the Python tools that allow us to\nimplement modern NLP applications and we\u2019ll conclude with some practical\nconsiderations.\n",
