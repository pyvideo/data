  "description": "Brief Summary\nWhy did a Python shell grow a web-based notebook? Did you know IPython had at least 3 notebooks before the one we see today in Jupyter? As open source maintainers, we can find ourselves saying \"sorry, out of scope\" a lot. Why do we do this? How do we recognize when our scope should change? Take a tour of some key points in Jupyter history, such as the evolution of the notebooks, and JupyterHub.\n\nOutline\nwhat do we mean when we say \"out of scope\"?\nwhen do our users get to tell us what to do?\nsome early IPython notebook history (2005-2007)\nJupyter (2013-14)\nJupyterHub (2015) started small\nZero-to-JupyterHub and the case for scalable JupyterHub (2017-2020)\n\n___\n\nJupyterCon brings together data scientists, business analysts, researchers, educators, developers, core Project\u00a0contributors, and tool creators for in-depth training, insightful keynotes, networking, and practical talks exploring\u00a0the Project Jupyter ecosystem.\n\nhttps://jupytercon.com/\u00a0\n\nJupyterCon is possible thanks to the generous support of our sponsors, and the labor of many volunteer organizers.\u00a0\n\nhttps://jupytercon.com/sponsors/\u00a0\nhttps://jupytercon.com/about/#Organizing%20Committee",
