  "description": "Brief Summary\nVoil\u00e0 turns Jupyter notebooks into standalone web applications. By leveraging the Jupyter widgets ecosystem, it makes it simple to design dashboards written e.g. in pure Python. In this talk, we present the latest developments of the Voil\u00e0 stack, the improved templating system and the fully asynchronous execution of notebooks. Then we lay out a roadmap for future development.\n\nOutline\nWe start this presention with a walk-through of Voil\u00e0's features. We also demonstrate the integration of Voil\u00e0 with JupyterLab and JupyterHub.\n\nThen we dive into how users can customize their dashboards with the template system, which can be used to create richer application layouts and themes. We feature the voila-reveal and voila-gridstack templates, which transform notebooks into slideshows and complex dashboards.\n\nIn the next section, we dive into some of Voil\u00e0 internals, and how a lot of the logic was pushed in upstream projects such as nbconvert and nbclient (for the asynchronous execution of notebooks).\n\nFinally, we lay out the roadmap for future development.",
