  "description": "Brief Summary\nIt is a common belief that Jupyter Notebooks and production are non compatible. This leads to a several consequence: * Almost no models see light of prod * Even for the most valuable models it takes weeks and weeks to deliver even simpler model to the prod We do believe that this can be drastically improved by providing a way of using Notebooks directly in the production\n\nOutline\nWhat you will learn: * How to make your Notebooks self-contained * How to build CI system around self contained notebooks * How to improve collaboration between teams with self-contained notebooks * How to deploy artifacts produce by self contained notebooks to the prod automatically What we expect from you: * You should know what notebooks are * You should have some experience in working with Notebooks and deploying to the production environment",
