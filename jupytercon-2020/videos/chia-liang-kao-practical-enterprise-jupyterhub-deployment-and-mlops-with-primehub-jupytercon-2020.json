  "description": "Brief Summary\nJupyter has become a critical component of the machine learning life cycle. However scaled enterprise deployments and making the Data Science Experience frictionless remain challenging. We address a few common issues with PrimeHub, an open-source enterprise offering based on JupyterHub, and investigate MLOps trends adjacent to the Jupyter ecosystem.\n\nOutline\nThis talk is intended for audience interested in larger scale Jupyter environment deployment in their organisation, particularly for machine learning applications.\n\nPrimeHub is an open-source enterprise offering based on JupyterHub, addressing a few common hurdles:\n\nadvanced resource scheduling for heterogenous GPU clusters\nmulti-tenancy and project isolations\ncustomizable and consistent ML environments per project\nhybrid development environment such as vscode and ssh within notebook instances\nauthorization and data access management\noperating in on-premises / hybrid / air-gapped environments\nWe also investigate a few trends adjacent to the day-to-day jupyter environment used by data scientists and data engineers, where the roles become more cross functional in the age of MLOps:\n\nworking with job schedulers from within Notebook\n\nmanaging ML model deployments",
