  "description": "Brief Summary\nIn this talk, Maria Naggaga, Diego Colombo, and Jon Sequeira will go over the lessons they learned through customer studies and how this feedback led to the decision to build a polyglot notebook. In this talk, we will discuss how we built a multi-language kernel (C#, F#, PowerShell, and JS) to tap into rich visualization libraries (in JS) and share data across languages.\n\nOutline\nSharing / Takeaways - Explore the features of the .NET kernel - The lesson and challenges we learned while building a multi-language notebook experience. Description The impact of Jupyter notebooks in industry and education have been monumental. For .NET languages to be present in the Jupyter ecosystem, it was essential to leverage the rich set of libraries that have been built by the ecosystem without the need to use wrappers. In this talk, we will share in detail how we created our multi-language kernel. We shall be discussing the following topics: - How we built a multi-language kernel. - Implementing magic command language. - Data sharing across all languages. - Creating connectable kernels - To connect to other language kernels(remote kernel) - To connect to data sources(data kernel) During the talk, they will dive into the .NET multi-language kernel architecture and features. They will conclude by demonstrating the data sharing across languages and their work with connectable kernels. You can expect engaging demos from the work we have done across enterprise and education.
