  "description": "Brief Summary\nElyra provides a visual editor for building AI pipelines, simplifying the conversion of multiple notebooks into batch jobs or workflows.  In this talk, we are going to work through a COVID-19 analytics scenario to deep dive on Elyra's pipeline editor, scrutinizing its capabilities, and revealing all magics that occur behind the scenes to enable you to take full advantage when creating AI pipelines\n\nOutline\nBuilding an AI pipeline for a model is hard, breaking down and modularizing a pipeline is harder.  A typical machine and deep learning pipeline begins as a series of preprocessing steps followed by experimentation, optimization, and, finally deployment.  Elyra provides a visual editor for building Notebook-based AI pipelines, that focus on the Data Science persona and simplify the conversion of multiple notebooks into batch jobs or workflows.  In this talk, we are going to deep dive on Elyra's pipeline editor, scrutinizing its capabilities, and revealing all the abstractions and magics that occur behind the scenes to enable you to take full advantage when creating your AI workflows.\n\nElyra Project Github page: https://github.com/elyra-ai/elyra Covid-19 Notebooks: https://github.com/CODAIT/covid-notebooks",
