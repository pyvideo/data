  "description": "Brief Summary\nElyra\u2019s metadata service arose out of the need to manage disparate pieces of information to address desired functionality. Our backend service uses a schema-driven approach to validate, store and retrieve this information via a simple REST API. To enhance the user experience, the backend service is accompanied by a frontend metadata editor extension to manage the metadata's lifecycle.\n\nOutline\nThis talk is targeted toward an early intermediate audience - we'll assume basic knowledge of JSON schema and REST. \nElyra\u2019s metadata service provides an organized and flexible way of storing metadata for any JupyterLab extension. In our presentation, we\u2019ll explain our implementation and use-cases for the metadata service. \nWe\u2019ll discuss the details of our schema-driven backend, how it is organized, and the next steps for extending this service. In addition, we\u2019ll discuss the API associated with our service. \nFurther, our presentation will exhibit a frontend JupyterLab editor extension that takes advantage of the metadata API. We\u2019ll show one use-case that has already been implemented, and explain how it could be used with other metadata as well. \nSource code can be found at https://github.com/elyra-ai/elyra",
