  "description": "Brief Summary\nXVega is a new C++ backend to the Vega Lite visualization system for the users of the xeus-cling C++ kernel. It enables access to a huge range of statistical and interactive visualizations, conforming to the notion of grammar of graphics, and being consistent with Vega Lite\u2019s JSON specification.\n\nOutline\nIn this talk, we introduce XVega, starting with the functional presentation of the various features it supports. Adequate examples will be shown to give a broad overview.\n\nThen, we dive into the internals of the package and showcase how we were able to provide an experience similar to Altair (the Python equivalent), despite the challenges of the C++ ecosystem.\n\nLastly, we discuss the current status of the package and explore the roadmap for future development.",
