  "description": "Brief Summary\ncovid19dashboards.com was started to aid sharing of data, analysis and visualizations related to the COVID-19 pandemic among the data scientists. The project aims to offer an accessible way for data professionals to share dashboards (that are updated with new data automatically) without requiring any expertise in front end development.\n\nOutline\nIn this talk, you'll learn how we leveraged existing PyData stack to fetch, explore, analyze and visualize the COVID-19 data. We'll show you how Jupyter Notebooks can be converted to web facing dashboards using fastpages. How fastpages leverages GitHub infrastructure to simplify the process of creating Jekyll blog posts from Jupyter Notebooks (among other formats) on GitHub Pages. And, we'll deep dive into how pipelines are set up to automate data updates to dashboards among other things needed to keep the website  functional.",
