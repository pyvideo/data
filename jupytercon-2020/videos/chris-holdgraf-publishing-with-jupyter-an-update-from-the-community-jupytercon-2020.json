  "description": "Brief Summary\nA short overview of some recent work across the Jupyter community towards publishing with the Jupyter ecosystem. This talk covers a few different projects and recent updates over the past year.\n\nOutline\nOne of the original use-cases for Jupyter Notebooks and Infrastructure was to support open, reproducible, interactive publishing workflows. That goal is still in the future, but there has been much progress made over the past years. There have been new developments in Jupyter technology, as well as new attempts at deploying and customizing that technology for particular communities and publishing use-cases. This session is a brief update from a couple of projects in this space. In particular you'll hear from nbconvert, Jupyter Book, and the Pangeo Gallery.",
