  "description": "Brief Summary\nIn this keynote I will be talking about the role of opensource in accelerating human knowledge through the lens of science in the age of data. I will delve into the nature of science, and computational thinking. Come to this talk if you enjoy walking through how data is eating science and how most forms of science are converging into scientific computing.\n\n_____\n\nJupyterCon brings together data scientists, business analysts, researchers, educators, developers, core Project\u00a0contributors, and tool creators for in-depth training, insightful keynotes, networking, and practical talks exploring\u00a0the Project Jupyter ecosystem.\n\nhttps://jupytercon.com/\u00a0\n\nJupyterCon is possible thanks to the generous support of our sponsors, and the labor of many volunteer organizers.\u00a0\n\nhttps://jupytercon.com/sponsors/\u00a0\nhttps://jupytercon.com/about/#Organizing%20Committee",
