  "description": "Brief Summary\nBecause notebooks provide the opportunity to examine and evaluate intermediate outputs, it is important to both provide intuitive interactions with those outputs and enhance methods to use and recall them. ipycollections and dfnotebook are JupyterLab extensions that respectively improve Jupyter's display of rich output collections and help users recall and reproduce past outputs.\n\nOutline\nIntroduction\nNotebooks have shifted the coding paradigm from one where programs are many lines of computation where input goes through many steps to generate final output to one where code is divided into smaller cells, each with its own output. A user examines those intermediate outputs to help decide what the next step is, potentially drilling down into specific features to gain understanding. If the output looks ok, a user plans the next steps. If the output looks suspect, a user may edit one or more cells and re-execute them. These tasks may be performed immediately or well in the future, perhaps by a different user, and thus support for them spans many concerns. In any setting, it is important to provide (a) intuitive interaction with output and (b) improved methods to use and recall output. ipycollections is a JupyterLab extension that seeks to improve Jupyter's display of rich output collections. The dataflow notebook (dfnotebook) is a JupyterLab extension that provides enhanced methods for referring to, recalling, and reproducing output. Together, they enhance the JupyterLab ecosystem by improving the way output is handled.\n",
