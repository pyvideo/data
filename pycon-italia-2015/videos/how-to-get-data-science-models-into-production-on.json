  "description": "One of the biggest challenges we have as data scientists is getting our\nmodels into production. I\u2019ve worked with Java developers to get models\ninto production and there aren\u2019t always the same libraries in Java as\nthere are in Python. Example try porting Scikitlearn code to Java.\nPossible solution: PMML (from last time) or you write spec. An even\nbetter solution: I will explain how to use Science Ops from YhatHQ to\nbuild better data products. Specifically I will talk about how to use a\nPython, Pandas etc to build a model. Test it locally and then deploy it\nso thatdevelopers can get an easy to use RESTful API. I will remark some\nof my experiences from working with it, and give a use case and some\narchitectural remarks. I\u2019ll also give a run down of alternatives to\nScience Ops that I\u2019ve found. Pre Requisites - some experience with\nPandas and the scientific Python would be beneficial. This talk is aimed\nat Data Science enthusiasts or professionals.\n",
