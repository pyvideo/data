  "description": "Machine Learning focuses on constructing algorithms for making\npredictions from data. These algorithms usually require huge amount of\ndata to analyse, thus demanding for high computational costs and\nrequiring easily scalable solutions to be effectively applied. These\nfactors favoured a more and more increasing interest in scaling up\nmachine learning applications.\n\nScikit-learn is one of the most popular machine learning library in\nPython, providing implementations for several machine learning methods,\nalong with datasets and (performance) evaluation algorithms.\n\nIn this talk some recipes to scale up machine learning algorithms with\nscikit-learn will be presented. The talk will go over several examples\nand case studies that will be presented in a problem-to-solution way in\norder to likely engage discussions during and after the talk.\n\nThe talk is intended for an intermediate level of audience. It requires\n(very) basic math skills and a good knowledge of the Python language.\nGood knowledge of the numpy and scipy packages is also a plus.\n",
