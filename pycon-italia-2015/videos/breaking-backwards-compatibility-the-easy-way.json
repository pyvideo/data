Well, there\u2019s no\nbetter way to do so than breaking the software they\u2019re using. In this\ntalk, I\u2019ll walk you through very good ways to do so by showing examples\ntaken from experience - because experience is the only thing that\nmatters (TM) - so that you\u2019ll be able, by the time this talk ends, to do\nthe same to your users. (P.S: If you\u2019ve a kinder hearth, you can also do\nthe exact oposite of what I\u2019ll say and keep your users happy.)\n",
