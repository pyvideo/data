Python 2), \nand the scientific community is now able more than ever to switch to Python 3. \nHowever, so far, the switch has not been done yet. \nThus, some reflections on this \u201cparticular\u201d community of pythonistas will \nconclude the talk in order to stimulate the discussion and derive together \npossible solutions and \u201cworkaround\u201d to support this change.\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": [], "copyright_text": "", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TE7xo1Xk9Fo", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TE7xo1Xk9Fo/maxresdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
