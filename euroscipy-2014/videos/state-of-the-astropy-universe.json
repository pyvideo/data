  "description": "The `Astropy Project <http://www.astropy.org/>`__ is a community effort\nto develop a single core package for Astronomy in Python and foster\ninteroperability between Python astronomy packages. In addition an\necosystem of `Astropy affiliated\npackages <http://www.astropy.org/affiliated/index.html>`__ is growing,\nsome of which are planned for inclusion in the Astropy core when they\nare matured, some with specialised functionality will remain as separate\nrepositories.\n\nI will give an overview of the features and implementation of the\nAstropy package, focusing on parts that are more generally useful for\nscientists and engineers (e.g.\n`astropy.units <http://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/units/index.html>`__\nand\n`astropy.modeling <http://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/modeling/index.html>`__)\nand highlight recent developments in the core and affiliated packages.\n",
