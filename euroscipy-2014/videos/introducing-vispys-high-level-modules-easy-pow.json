  "description": "Vispy is an OpenGL-based interactive visualization library in Python.\nIts goal is to make it easy to create beautiful and fast dynamic\nvisualizations. For example, scientific plotting of tens of millions of\npoints, interacting with complex polygonial models, and (dynamic) volume\nrendering.\n\nVispy is a young library and very actively developed. Until recently, a\nuser would have to know OpenGL in order to work with Vispy. Now that the\nhigher levels of the package take shape, this is no longer the case.\nWhen these layers are finalized, the number of people that can benefit\nfrom vispy will significantly increase.\n\nWe will give a brief overview of the Vispy package, and focus on the\nhigher level modules that will make it easy to visualize images, lines,\netc., and organize these object in a scene graph. Of course we will\ndemonstrate this with several examples.\n\nWe will also talk about our progress in other areas, such as a browser\nbackend and integration with the IPython notebook.\n\nhttp://vispy.org/\n",
