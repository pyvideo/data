  "description": "This talk will discuss the design and implementation of a Python-based\ntool-set to aid in assessing the response of the UK's Advanced Gas\nReactor nuclear power stations to earthquakes. The seismic analyses\nthemselves are carried out with a commercial Finite Element solver, but\nunderstanding the raw data this produces requires customised\npost-processing and visualisation tools. Extending the existing tools\nhad become increasingly difficult and a decision was made to develop a\nnew, Python-based tool-set. This comprises of a post-processing\nframework (\"aftershock\") which includes an an embedded Python\ninterpreter, and a plotting package (\"afterplot\") based on numpy and\nmatplotlib.\n\nThe new tool-set had to be significantly more flexible and easier to\nmaintain than the existing code-base, while allowing the majority of\ndevelopment to be carried out by engineers with little training in\nsoftware development. The resulting architecture will be described with\na focus on exploring how the design drivers were met and the successes\nand challenges arising from the choices made.\n",
