It's a new easy way to turn computer vision models into web-based demos and has some advantages over the conventional ways which use OpenCV. In this talk, I will demonstrate the development process using these libraries and show a variety of examples so that we see how easy and useful they are and can make use of them in daily development and research.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \u95dc\u65bc\u8b1b\u8005 About Speaker - Yuichiro Tachibana \ud83d\ude80\nYuichiro works as a professional software developer and also loves contributing to OSS projects.
