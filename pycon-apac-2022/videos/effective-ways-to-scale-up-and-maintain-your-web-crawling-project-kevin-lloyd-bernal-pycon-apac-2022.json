Such undertaking could be achieved through the use of Spiders which has two components: (1) Crawling \u2014\u2014 the means to find the content of interest and (2) Extraction \u2014\u2014 the means of turning data into a structured format. However, the web changes so fast that scaling and maintaining these spiders become an issue. In this talk, we will create an end-to-end web crawling project that walks through each crucial step, the challenges for each stage, and the available tools and techniques to overcome such obstacles. We will be using Scrapy, one of the most popular web crawling Python frameworks, together with its ecosystem of tools.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \u8b1b\u8005\u4ecb\u7d39 About Speaker - Kevin Lloyd Bernal \ud83d\ude80\nKevin is currently a Software Engineer in Zyte.
