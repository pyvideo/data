In my talk, I will take you through Python's internals by showing you how to implement a new operator, a pipe operator. This will take you on a journey through all the steps Python takes to execute your code, from parsing your code to evaluating bytecode. By the end, you will have a mental framework that allows you to dive into more comprehensive resources with more confidence. You don't have to be an expert in Python to follow along, although some affinity with Python will help.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \u8b1b\u8005\u4ecb\u7d39 About Speaker - Sebastiaan Zeeff \ud83d\ude80\nSebastiaan is a Software Engineer for the Ordina Pythoneers and a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation.
