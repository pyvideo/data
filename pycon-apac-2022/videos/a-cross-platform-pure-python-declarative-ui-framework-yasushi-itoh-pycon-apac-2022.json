It seems that it is gradually being accepted by the market. These frameworks are written in the programming language it will be used and are easy to use and hack. The question arises here. Why doesn't Python have such a framework written in Python? In this talk, I would like to guess and explain the reason in my own way and introduce such a thing I made with the spirit of \"if you don't have one, just make one\".\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \u8b1b\u8005\u4ecb\u7d39 About Speaker - Yasushi Itoh \ud83d\ude80\nHi, I'm a software engineer at Mercari inc. in Japan. I have been a software engineer for almost 19 years. I'm a Pythonista and Gopher and Rubyist and also love many other programming languages. I first encountered Python over 20 years ago and have used it occasionally for work and pleasure. About my past python experience, for example, I created https://github.com/i2y/mochi for my hobby, I created document translation (combination of Natural Language Processing, Image Processing and ML) at work.\n\n#python pycontw #pyconapac2022 #declarative #composemultiplatform\n\nFollow \u201cPyCon Taiwan\u201d\n\u2b50\ufe0f Official Website: https://tw.pycon.org\n\u2b50\ufe0f Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Twitter: https://twitter.com/PyConTW\n\u2b50\ufe0f LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Blogger: https://pycontw.blogspot.com",
