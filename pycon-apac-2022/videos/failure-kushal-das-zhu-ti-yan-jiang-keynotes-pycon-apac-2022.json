Starting from learning a new programming language (or actually failing at it in a grand way), to the failure of removing any temporary directory in a long running service. I will also talk about how I failed to understand many social and ethical points of technology and things improved with more failings over the years.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \u8b1b\u8005\u4ecb\u7d39 About Speaker - Kushal Das \ud83d\ude80\nKushal Das is a public interest technologist, who is currently helping with privacy and security at https://sunet.se.
