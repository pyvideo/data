I love anime and fell in love with a movie \"Sing a Bit of Harmony\"(\u8b93\u6211\u807d\u898b\u611b\u7684\u6b4c\u8072). The character, AI (robot) Shion, is very attractive from an engineer's point of view, and I wanted to implement even some of its functions. I implemented shion.py, which allows humans to enter text by voice and the script responds by voice. In short, it is like a smart speaker that parrots. In other word, the program reads aloud the spoken texts. I started with an easy implementation (with Web API and OS command) to check the idea and then reworked it with pre-trained machine learning models to get closer to Shion. I will share those implementations with you. I would be happy to provide a little inspiration for your Maker project.

He started Python as a hobby in 2017 and fell in love with it. He is engaged in Natural Language Processing as a data scientist at Uzabase, inc. Tokyo, Japan from 2019. He is working on the Python community in Japan as a staff of the following event: - [PyCon Japan](https://www.pycon.jp/organizer/index.html): the largest PyCon in Japan - staff on 2019 and 2020 (Program committee, lead on 2020) - [chair](https://pyconjp.blogspot.com/2020/10/pyconjp-2021-chair.html) on 2021 He gave a talk (and lightning talks) at many PyCons in Japan and abroad. - EuroPython 2020, [PyCon APAC 2020](https://youtu.be/JiXnEA7pM7U) (English) He loves anime (Japanese animetation) as much as Python, and implements ideas related to some anime with Python. In 2022, he write code related to \"Sing a Bit of Harmony\" (e.g. Twitter bot, prototyping AI character, e.t.c.).\n\n#python #pycontw #pyconapac2022 #tts #asr #subprocess #speechrecognition #ttslearn #espnet #soundfile #huggingface\n\nFollow \u201cPyCon Taiwan\u201d\n\u2b50\ufe0f Official Website: https://tw.pycon.org\n\u2b50\ufe0f Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Twitter: https://twitter.com/PyConTW\n\u2b50\ufe0f LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Blogger: https://pycontw.blogspot.com",
