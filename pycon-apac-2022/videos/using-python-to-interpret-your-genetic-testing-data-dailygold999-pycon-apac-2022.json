There\u2019s no doubt that healthcare has become a critical issue from individuals to industries in recent years. Everyone\u2019s genetic information give a hint about how likely we get a disease or who is at high risk of a specific symptom, which is also humorously called fortune-telling in scientific way in the field of life science. In addition to machine learning or FinTech, Python as a popular language in data science, cannot only help us to translate genetic codes into health information, but also can be used to build a healthcare information platform based-on genetic testing results. In this talk, we are going to introduce the basic knowledge about genetic testing and how we use Python to tackle this healthcare-related issue for the people whom are interested in applying python in biomedical industries.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \u8b1b\u8005\u4ecb\u7d39 About Speaker - DailyGold999 \ud83d\ude80\nWe comes from the team from Molecular Sciences and Digital Innovation Center (MSDIC) in Genetics Generation Advancement Corporation (GGA) in Taiwan, which provides solutions on bioinformatics, material science, electronics laboratory management systems, and biological modeling. Nowadays, some of our partners, are dedicated to providing solutions on handling the bio-data, including next generation sequencing data or another bio-resources, to generate the biological meaning and address the needs from customers. We have built a platform called \"ArrayMeister\" to find out genetic effects on accessibility of insurance. On the other hand, we also have a official website and manage Youtube channel to provide new information about data science and product training course. We are glad to enjoy the meeting on Pycon and share the technique or knowhow on Python.\n\n#python #pycontw #pyconapac2022 #arraymeister\n\nFollow \u201cPyCon Taiwan\u201d\n\u2b50\ufe0f Official Website: https://tw.pycon.org\n\u2b50\ufe0f Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Twitter: https://twitter.com/PyConTW\n\u2b50\ufe0f LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Blogger: https://pycontw.blogspot.com",
