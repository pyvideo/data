Python plays a vital role in maximizing the value a person can get from geodata. This talk will provide a short background on how a geo* scientist works and will tackle some of the Python libraries being used in the geo* space from reading/writing data, and visualization to the different workflows.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \u8b1b\u8005\u4ecb\u7d39 About Speaker - Ian Panganiban \ud83d\ude80\nIan is currently leading the team of engineers at Iraya Energies in optimizing the cloud infrastructure for development, data processing, and data retrieval at its forefront. He worked on various geospatial-centric research and development for applications ranging from indoor mapping/GIS for building maintenance, site-suitability of tidal-current energy, crop yield estimation and monitoring, hydropower plant project monitoring and reforestation. These roles and engagements allowed him to work in different aspects of software development, infrastructure, data science, and machine learning.\n\n#python #pycontw #pyconapac2022 #geospace #geodata #geopandas #rasterio #science \n\nFollow \u201cPyCon Taiwan\u201d\n\u2b50\ufe0f Official Website: https://tw.pycon.org\n\u2b50\ufe0f Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Twitter: https://twitter.com/PyConTW\n\u2b50\ufe0f LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Blogger: https://pycontw.blogspot.com",
