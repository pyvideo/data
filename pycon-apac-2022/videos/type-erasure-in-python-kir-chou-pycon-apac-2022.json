Python is one of the iconic dynamically-typed programming languages which allows to determine the type of variable in runtime; therefore, the Python community focuses on Type Hints (PEP 484) and static type checker (such as mypy and pyre) recently. Since the concept of type erasure is rarely discussed within the community, in this talk, the speaker picks examples in C++, describes the reason why Python needs type erasure and provides one example to illustrate how to apply it to your CPython extension module.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \u95dc\u65bc\u8b1b\u8005 About Speaker - Kir Chou \ud83d\ude80\nA code monkey with some experience in Geo service and Search services.
