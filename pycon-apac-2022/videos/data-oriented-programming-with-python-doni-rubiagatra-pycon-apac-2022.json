The cool thing is that DOP is language-agnostic: it is applicable to any programming language. In Python, we commonly taught using OOP for abstraction in our code. Information systems around software constructs that combine code and data (e.g. objects instantiated from classes). But in DOP, it encourages the separation of code from data. Moreover, DOP provides guidelines about how to represent and manipulate data. The essence of DOP is that it treats data as a first-class citizen; it gives developers the ability to manipulate data inside a program with the same simplicity as they manipulate numbers or strings. In this talk, we will explore what, when, and how to use DOP with Python.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \u8b1b\u8005\u4ecb\u7d39 About Speaker - Shreya Khurana \ud83d\ude80\nHead of Engineering at Zero One Group | Tech Mentor | Mathematical Thinker\n\n#python #pycontw #pyconapac2022 #dataoriented #dop\n\nFollow \u201cPyCon Taiwan\u201d\n\u2b50\ufe0f Official Website: https://tw.pycon.org\n\u2b50\ufe0f Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Twitter: https://twitter.com/PyConTW\n\u2b50\ufe0f LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Blogger: https://pycontw.blogspot.com",
