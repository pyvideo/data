This talk will discuss how we further it by utilizing markup processors as extensions and generate more effective documentation. This will be also further elaborated on through a case study showcasing how integrating the documentation can improve the overall benefit towards a project and mistakes to avoid while attempting the integration.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \u8b1b\u8005\u4ecb\u7d39 About Speaker - Renaldi Gondosubroto \ud83d\ude80\nRenaldi Gondosubroto is the Founder and CEO of GReS Studio, a company that promotes the concept of the Internet of Things by creating solutions for problems around the community while utilizing the concept.
