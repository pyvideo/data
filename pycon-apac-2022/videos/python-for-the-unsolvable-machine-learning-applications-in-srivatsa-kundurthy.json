Chaos theory is the study of systems that appear random but are completely deterministic, such as the double pendulum. Due to factors such as open-source libraries and an active community, Python has allowed for new machine learning progress for more efficient understanding of chaos theory, particularly with the application of ML models for new perspectives on problems considered \u201cunsolvable\u201d. In this talk, we discuss Python implementations of physics-informed neural networks, PINNs, for chaotic physics scenarios. The key takeaways are a refreshing introduction to the fascinating field of chaos theory and an appreciation for how Python is impacting physics research.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \u8b1b\u8005\u4ecb\u7d39 About Speaker - Srivatsa Kundurthy \ud83d\ude80\nSrivatsa Kundurthy is a student based in the Greater New York City Area. As a Python practitioner, his projects include Open Source Intelligence tools for extracting public data and Python notebooks for explaining and simulating chaotic dynamical systems. His work in machine learning includes studying computer vision applications and researching neural networks for predicting states of chaotic dynamical systems. Additionally, he is working with the LAION Research Group to develop and release the world\u2019s largest image-text dataset. Apart from Machine Learning Research, Srivatsa is greatly interested in technology policy and community-related issues, particularly those extending to the accessibility of programming education. On the side, Srivatsa enjoys science communication and stargazing.\n\n#python pycontw #pyconapac2022 #machinelearning \n\nFollow \u201cPyCon Taiwan\u201d\n\u2b50\ufe0f Official Website: https://tw.pycon.org\n\u2b50\ufe0f Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Twitter: https://twitter.com/PyConTW\n\u2b50\ufe0f LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Blogger: https://pycontw.blogspot.com",
