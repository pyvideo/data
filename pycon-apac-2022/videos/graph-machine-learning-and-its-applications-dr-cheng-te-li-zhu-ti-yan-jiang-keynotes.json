With the blooming and advances of deep learning, novel Graph Representation Learning (GRL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) models, which learn the representations of nodes and graphs, are invented and widely applied on social and information networks. How can GRL/GNN be applied for data science? In this talk, I will utilize our recent research outcomes to exhibit what, where, and how graph machine learning can benefit a variety of tasks in data science. First, I will first give a review on both unsupervised and supervised GRL for typical NC and LP tasks. Second, I will show that GRL can be applied to better model and exploit diverse relationships between various types of nodes in the realms of recommender systems and knowledge base. Third, through the applications to fake news detection, air quality forecasting, traffic flow forecasting, customs fraud detection, and stock price prediction, I will further exhibit that GRL and GNN are powerful even when the graphs cannot be observed.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \u8b1b\u8005\u4ecb\u7d39 About Speaker - Dr. Cheng-Te Li \ud83d\ude80\nDr. Cheng-Te Li is now an Associate Professor at Institute of Data Science, National Cheng Kung University (NCKU), Tainan, Taiwan.
