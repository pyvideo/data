One of the fundamental techniques is image denoising, i.e., to reduce noise from images. In the talk, we will firstly introduce the background and its related applications about image denoising. Then, a classic Deep Learning method: DnCNN will be taken as an example, to describe its main concepts and implementation in PyTorch. Finally, we will show a practical use case for old film restoration.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \u8b1b\u8005\u4ecb\u7d39 About Speaker - \u8607\u5609\u51a0 (Jia-Kuan, Su) \ud83d\ude80\nJ.K. is an AI Researcher and Developer in startup, he is always willing to share and discuss AI techniques with people.
