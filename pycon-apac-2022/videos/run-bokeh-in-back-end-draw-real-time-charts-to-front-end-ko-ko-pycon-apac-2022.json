If you need an interactive chart on website, which allowed user can zoom in/out or select time axis, you might choose Bokeh to generate HTML/JS with charts that are interactable. But what if your need a real-time charts that can draw charts dynamically according to the change of data? In this presentation, I will share my experience of setup Bokeh in back-end and getting a real-time chart in front-end, so that data scientists can work with web developer easily and happily.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \u8b1b\u8005\u4ecb\u7d39 About Speaker - Ko Ko \ud83d\ude80\nKo Ko is a Microsoft AI MVP and a popular lecturer in Taiwan.
