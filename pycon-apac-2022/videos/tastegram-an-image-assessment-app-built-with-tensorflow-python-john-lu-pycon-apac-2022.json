It uses a user-friendly API for defining and training neural networks. It provides stable Python APIs and embraces the style and ergonomics of the Python language. The goal of this talk is to help developers get familiar with this end-to-end platform. To do so, we're going to build an Image Assessment application, TasteGram, completely from scratch all using Python.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \u8b1b\u8005\u4ecb\u7d39 About Speaker - John Lu \ud83d\ude80\nJohn is an Android Developer at Seekrtech, currently focusing on developing a gamified To-do list app, WaterDo. He is deeply motivated by challenges and tends to be excited by breaking conventional ways of thinking and doing. With two years of experience in Machine Learning research, he works on combining the latest AI technology and design to build fun and creative applications.\n\n#python #pycontw #pyconapac2022 #tensorflow #machinelearning #neuralnetwork #tastegram #imageassessment\n\nFollow \u201cPyCon Taiwan\u201d\n\u2b50\ufe0f Official Website: https://tw.pycon.org\n\u2b50\ufe0f Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Twitter: https://twitter.com/PyConTW\n\u2b50\ufe0f LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Blogger: https://pycontw.blogspot.com",
