I'll discuss some of the lessons that we learned through experimentation on sequence-to-sequence models - about architecture size, vocabulary, the relation between validation and training error, etc. Working in ML makes you realize one thing\u2013it\u2019s not always black and white and it doesn\u2019t have to be a black box! The process of building good NLP models is not a straight line. Not-so-little decisions can often require tons of experiments, but in this talk, I share my modeling experience and lessons learned so your walk isn't as random as mine was!\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \u8b1b\u8005\u4ecb\u7d39 About Speaker - Shreya Khurana \ud83d\ude80\nHi, I'm a data scientist in the Domain Search team at GoDaddy which researches, develops, and deploys deep learning models for Godaddy\u2019s domain business. I enjoy working with data in general and more specifically building NLP models. I'm a Python enthusiast and enjoy sharing my learnings with the community - I've previously presented at the Grace Hopper Conference, PyCon US, EuroPython and GeoPython.\n\n#pycontw #pyconapac2022 #python #sequencetosequence #nlp #machinelearning \n\nFollow \u201cPyCon Taiwan\u201d\n\u2b50\ufe0f Official Website: https://tw.pycon.org\n\u2b50\ufe0f Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Twitter: https://twitter.com/PyConTW\n\u2b50\ufe0f LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pycontw\n\u2b50\ufe0f Blogger: https://pycontw.blogspot.com",
