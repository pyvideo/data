The rapid creation of new tools, new standards, and new best practices to build defences against threats (both historic and anticipated) represents real action towards a fundamentally more secure technological ecosystem. But what, exactly, are we protecting? Who are we protecting it from? And what responsibility do we as individuals have to participate?\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \u8b1b\u8005\u4ecb\u7d39 About Speaker - Dustin Ingram \ud83d\ude80\nDustin is a software engineer on Google\u2019s Open Source Security Team, where he works on improving the security of open-source software that Google & the rest of the world relies on. He\u2019s also a director of the Python Software Foundation, where he helps ensure the long-term success of one very big open-source Python project you've probably heard of: Python itself, as well as the community around it.
