  "description": "Writing code is hard. Writing beautiful code is even more so.\n\nHow to write code that is pleasant to read, easy to understand and joy\nto maintain?\n\nSimple things like using right variable names, avoiding to much nesting,\nusing white space and comments etc. makes a lot difference to\nreadability of the code. Even though these things look very simple, it\nis very hard to put them in practice.\n\nIn this talk, I\u2019ll try summarise the age old wisdom of writing beautiful\ncode using python examples.\n\n\n| Choose meaningful variable names\n| Avoid generic names\n| Give names to magic numbers\n| Avoid too many nested levels\n| Avoid too many branches\n| Use \u201ctelephone test\u201d for readability\n| Use idioms of the language\n| Avoid superficial comments\n| Add comments to explain complex piece of software\n| Avoid writing comments by writing code clearly\n| Avoid side effects\n| Try to make functions stateless\n| Let one function do one thing well\n| Write smaller functions - the 7 plus or minus 2 rule\n| Separate \u201cwhat\u201d from \u201chow\u201d\n| Don\u2019t sacrifice clarity for efficiency\n| The Zen of Python\n",
