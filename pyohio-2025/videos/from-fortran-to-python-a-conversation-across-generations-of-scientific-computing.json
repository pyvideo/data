    "description": "What was it like to write scientific code before personal computers,\nIDEs, or instant feedback loops? In this talk, a mother and son \u2014 one\nwho programmed in *Fortran* using punch cards and one who writes\n*Python* today in modern IDEs \u2014 reflect on how programming practices,\ntools, and mindsets have evolved across generations.\n\nThrough personal stories and a short demo of a scientific simulation, we\ncompare the experience of coding the same computational model decades\napart. This talk is less about syntax and more about what has changed\n(and what hasn\u2019t) in how we approach problem-solving, debugging, and\nscientific thinking in code.\n\nWhether you're a veteran programmer or just getting started, join us for\na thoughtful, engaging, and intergenerational exploration of scientific\ncomputing \u2014 from punch cards to *Python* notebooks and modern IDEs.\n",
