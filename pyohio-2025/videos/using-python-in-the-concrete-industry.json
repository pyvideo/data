    "description": "Working in the concrete industry, I often found myself doing tasks that\nfelt repetitive. Python has been great for automating these tasks, with\nthe goal being to both increase efficiency and remove opportunities for\nhuman error, which can be costly in this business. Automating things has\nalso taught me that seemingly simple tasks can be more complicated than\nthey seem.\n\nAs part of this I will discuss libraries that I have found useful,\nincluding ezdxf, which can be used for drafting and creating files that\ncan be read by CAD software.\n\nPython really is a programming language for everyone, and can have a use\ncase in places you might not expect.\n",
