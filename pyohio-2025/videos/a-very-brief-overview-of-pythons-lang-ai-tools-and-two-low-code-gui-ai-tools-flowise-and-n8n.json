    "description": "AI is the theme of the moment - and even as a pythonista you might not\nknow where to begin, or you may have started as you had time - and\nwished to go further. This talk is a guide about where some have gone,\nand where you might want to go with AI in python. But it is not the last\nstop. This talk is designed to be a stating guide to move from hobbyist\nlevel AI learning to more production-ready coding.\n\nOften where you begin is with some of the low-code GUI tools - for\ninstance Flowise [ flowiseai.com] - where with a api key and some clicks\nyou can quickly build a chatbot - and then you leant to add complexity -\nmaybe you pull out some embeddable code -or start to have more than one\nagent talk to each other, or with some walk-throughs you build a\nknowledge-base of documents for your bot ( a RAG - Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration ) and now it knows - all your recipes.\n\nLater you want to give your bot some \"hands\" or rather tools and later\nyou connect to N8N [n8n.io] - which is a flexible workflow automation.\nYou've made your bot reach out into the world to do something (aka made\nit \"Agentic\").\n\nBut then you want more control - and stability - so you look to do what\nyou previously did in low-code- directly in python, with a view to\nproduction.\n\nThis is when you look to the \"Lang\" flavor tools: Langchain, Langflow,\nLangraph, and Langsmith.\n\nGiven the time, this will be a very quick tour of these concepts with\nboth images and code shown - so it won't be a line-by line build along.\nA repo and suggested resources will be provided at the end.\n",
