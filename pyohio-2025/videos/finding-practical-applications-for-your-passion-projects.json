    "description": "Getting from \"I'm passionate about this topic\" to actually working in\n(or on) your dream is a wild leap. Lessons learned from traveling this\npath the hard way, from finding the right niche for your passion project\nto getting the right collaborators on board, can't be taught in a\nclassroom.\n\nThese are some of the lessons formed over six years of growing an\ninternational charity from two through to 6000 volunteers across the\nglobe. You'll learn tips on applying Python's ecosystem of third-party\ntools to your project's aim, assembling a diverse team that can assess\nthe needs of a diverse world, and using Python-based tools to build your\ndream project.\n",
