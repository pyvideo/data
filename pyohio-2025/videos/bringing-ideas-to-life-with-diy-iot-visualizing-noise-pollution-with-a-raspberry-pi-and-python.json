    "description": "Discover how to harness the power of IoT to tackle real-world problems\nusing affordable and accessible technology. In this talk, you'll learn\nhow to build an IoT system from off-the-shelf components, collect data\nfrom sensors, and visualize the data to tell compelling stories.\n\n| In this talk I'll showcase a project where I used a Raspberry Pi,\n  environmental sensor, and Python to measure and monitor noise levels.\n  This project demonstrates how to design and implement an IoT solution\n  from concept to deployment, including using InfluxDB and Grafana for\n  real-time data visualization, all running in Docker.\n| By the end of this talk, you'll have the skills to bring various\n  pieces of technology together to solve real-world problems. Whether\n  you're an enthusiast, developer, or researcher, this session will\n  inspire you to apply open-source tools and inexpensive hardware in\n  innovative ways to address the challenges in your every day life.\n",
