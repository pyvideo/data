    "description": "Everyone\u2019s talking about AI Agents! But what are they, and how can you\nbuild them? This talk cuts through the hype. Drawing on a year spent\ndeveloping a GenAI platform, I'll show you that creating powerful AI\nAgents is within your reach, no advanced degree required.\n\nWe\u2019ll define agents practically: Large Language Models combined with\ntools and memory. Moving beyond the abstract definition, I\u2019ll show you\nhow to build your first agent using the OpenAI Python SDK and\nfundamental Python concepts you\u2019re already familiar with: functions,\nloops, and conditions. From there, I will demonstrate how you can use\nthe CrewAI framework to abstract away the boilerplate code, allowing for\nsimpler setup of multi-agent systems.\n\nBy the end, you won't just understand agents; you'll be equipped and\ninspired to build your own, ready to tackle custom tasks by integrating\nthe APIs that matter to you.\n",
