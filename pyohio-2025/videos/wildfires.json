    "description": "Wildfires have become more frequent nationwide, causing chaos not only\nwithin fire zones but also affecting communities far away through smoke\nand poor air quality. In this talk, we'll explore the world of\nwildfires, understanding common terminology and clearing up\nmisconceptions. We will explore data sources, potential file formats,\nand essential data fields using fire perimeter data. By leveraging\nPython and Geopandas we will clean a dataset, analyze the cleaned\ndataset, and finally create compelling visualizations of our wildfire\ndata.\n",
