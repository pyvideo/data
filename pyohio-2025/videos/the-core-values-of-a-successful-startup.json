    "description": "What really makes a startup succeed? It\u2019s not just product-market fit or\nclever tech\u2014it\u2019s the people and the culture they create together. In\nthis talk, I\u2019ll share lessons from my journey across three startups at\ndifferent stages, through acquisitions, pivots, and cultural\ntransformations.\n\n| I\u2019ll explore the core values that I\u2019ve seen make the biggest\n  difference\u2014not the ones painted on walls, but the ones that show up in\n  code reviews, standups, hard conversations, and late-night problem\n  solving. We\u2019ll talk about:\n| \u2022 Authenticity over performance\n| \u2022 Love and empathy as engineering virtues\n| \u2022 Presence and trust in high-stakes uncertainty\n| \u2022 Balance, sustainability, and knowing when to push or pause\n| \u2022 Grit, growth, and intentionality\u2014what it really takes to build\n  something that lasts\n\nThis talk is for anyone who wants to build or be part of a values-driven\nteam: engineers, tech leads, future founders, or just curious humans\ntrying to build things that matter.\n",
