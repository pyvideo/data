    "description": "Working in tech is a never-ending stream of choices: from the language,\nplatform, and framework we use to the vendors we put our trust (and\nmoney) in. Many of us live in fear that our next choice will turn sour,\nand will end up being a resume-generating event for us.\n\nIn reality, there is often a lot more good than you'd expect from those\nseemingly bad tech choices. In this session, I'll look back on several\nfailed implementations, poor calls, and wasted weekends to see, with the\nbenefit of hindsight, how they turned out to be decent decisions after\nall.\n",
