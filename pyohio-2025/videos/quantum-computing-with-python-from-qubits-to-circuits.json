    "description": "Quantum Computing with Python: From Qubits to Circuits\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nHave you heard the buzz about quantum computing and wondered what it\n*actually* means? This beginner-friendly talk introduces the\nfundamentals of quantum computing using the language we all love;\nPython.\n\nWe\u2019ll start by breaking down core quantum concepts like **qubits**,\n**superposition**, **entanglement**, and **quantum gates** in simple\nterms. Then, we\u2019ll bring those ideas to life with real code using\n`Qiskit <https://qiskit.org/>`__, a powerful open-source quantum\ncomputing framework built in Python.\n\nYou'll learn how to:\n\n-  Simulate qubits and quantum circuits\n-  Visualize quantum states and interference\n-  Run your own quantum circuits on a real IBM quantum computer (yes,\n   free and live!)\n\nAlong the way, we\u2019ll highlight where quantum computing stands today,\nwhere Python fits in the ecosystem, and how you can get involved;\nwhether you're a hobbyist, educator, or software developer.\n\nNo prior knowledge of quantum mechanics is needed. If you can write a\n'for' loop, you can build your first quantum circuit.\n",
