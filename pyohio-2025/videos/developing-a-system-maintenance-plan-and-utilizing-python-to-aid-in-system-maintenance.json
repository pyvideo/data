    "description": "Overtime, systems can experience rapid growth and become unstable\nwithout proper management. Managing that growth while maintaining the\nsystem can become a challenge. We will explore system maintenance in the\ncontext of a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Team\u2019s plan for GIS\nsystem maintenance. We will go over the reasons for having a system\nmaintenance plan, the components of our plan, and things to consider\nwhen making your own maintenance plan.\n",
