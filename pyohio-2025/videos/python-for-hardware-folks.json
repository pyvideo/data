    "description": "Python is a versatile language, and it\u2019s often the go-to language for\ndata scientists, machine learning engineers, and web developers, among\nothers. However, often notably absent from this list are those working\non and developing things in the physical world. Too often is the humble\nhardware engineer forgotten, doomed to a fate of spreadsheets. But what\nif I told you there was a whole world of hardware-focused Python? This\ntalk will explore various examples of Python in the world of hardware\nfolks, including building test fixtures, data acquisition, and\nindustrial automation. We\u2019ll also look at other issues, including what\nare the alternatives and why adoption of Python can be challenging. This\ntalk is meant for everyone, but especially those who love or want to\ntinker with hardware.\n",
