    "description": "As a multi-paradigm language, Python gives its users the freedom to\nsolve problems in a vast number of ways. However, this freedom comes\nwith a cost: we must resist the urge to use quick, unsustainable\napproaches in order to avoid the plague that is software complexity. For\nmany real world problems, using familiar techniques like mutable state\nand imperative programming make it easier to complete the task while\nyielding a more complex codebase. In many cases, functional programming\noffers a way to write simpler code, but the difficulty of committing to\nit makes it impractical or unappealing to developers.\n\nInspired by the 2006 paper `Out of the Tar\nPit <https://curtclifton.net/papers/MoseleyMarks06a.pdf>`__, and the\n2011 talk `Simple Made\nEasy <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4>`__ by Rich Hickey,\n`Labrea <https://github.com/8451/labrea>`__ is a Python framework that\nseeks to make the happy path one that results in a simpler codebase that\nis functional, declarative, and composable. Learn about how Labrea\nallowed developers at 84.51\u00ba (Kroger) to pull the company's most\ncomplicated coupon recommender system out of the slow death march of\nsoftware complexity, and how it might help you.\n",
