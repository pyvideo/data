    "description": "Have you ever wondered how Machine Learning could automate your tasks\nbut hesitated due to time constraints or a lack of specialized coding\nskills? If so, this session is for you!\n\nTraditionally, building predictive models required specialized coding\nabilities and a deep understanding of statistical concepts. However,\nAutoML simplifies this process and can automatically create machine\nlearning models from your data. This session will empower you to use a\nsimple, open-source AutoML tool to quickly create Python-based machine\nlearning prototypes (using the pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn\nframeworks) without writing any code. A live demonstration will show how\nAutoML seamlessly (i) processes input data, (ii) selects and trains the\nbest algorithms for your specific use case, (iii) generates reproducible\nPython code for easy integration, and most importantly, (iv) how to\ninterpret the results.\n\nDiscover how AutoML can turn your transform your data into actionable\ninsights!\n",
