    "description": "Have you ever been handed a mystery database and told, \u201cYou\u2019ll figure it\nout\u201d... with no documentation, no SME, and no time?\n\nIn this session, I\u2019ll share how I turned a frustrating (and very\nrelatable) real-world problem into a capstone project for Kaggle's Gen\nAI 5 Day Intensive Course with Google: building a GenAI-powered Database\nDocumentation Agent using Python, SQLite, and the Gemini API \u2014 aka what\nI like to call my SME Ghost Protocol.\n\nI\u2019ll walk through how I used GenAI to automatically generate natural\nlanguage summaries, answer ad-hoc schema questions, and create entity\nrelationship diagrams \u2014 even when human help wasn't available.\n\nWe'll dive into the challenges of working with GenAI as a \"coding\npartner,\" designing prompts like communication plans, and lessons\nlearned the hard way about iteration, hallucination, and debugging when\nyou're flying solo.\n\nExpect live demos, practical takeaways, a little workplace sarcasm, and\nideas for how you can launch your own SME Ghost Protocol \u2014 because\nsometimes, GenAI is the only teammate who shows up.\ud83d\udc7b\n",
