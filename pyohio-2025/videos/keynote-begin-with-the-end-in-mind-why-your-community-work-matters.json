In this keynote, I will reflect on my journey from contributing to\nDjango Girls to leading PyLadies Ghana and building inclusive tech\ncommunities across Africa. Drawing lessons from open source leadership,\ncultural identity, and personal growth, we will explore what it truly\nmeans to build communities that outlast us. This talk challenges\nattendees to rethink community involvement not just as volunteering, but\nas systems-building, infused with purpose, clarity, and intention.\nThrough storytelling, reflection, and real-world examples, we will\nexperience how every contribution can create ripple effects of\nconfidence, leadership, and global impact.\n",
