    "description": "I don\u2019t get paid to write code. I have no boss to answer to. I have no\npartner to work with. Most of the apps I produce are for me to use. When\nI was learning Python with online videos, I was introduced to testing. I\nfound it interesting, but it felt time consuming.\n\nThen I went back to an old app I had written and wanted to re-work. I\nwas lost. I couldn\u2019t even figure out where to begin to make it work\nagain. I slowly decided to integrate testing into my personal workflow\non projects. Then I came upon an unexpected benefit: by testing my code\nin a Django app, I was able to better learn what the library was doing\nto convert a request into a response. I knew the steps, but through\nwriting a test with an expected output and seeing the error messages on\nfailures, I now intuitively understand how this process works. This talk\nwill demonstrate that.\n",
