    "description": "Monitoring the health of city streets and roadways is expensive,\ntime-consuming, and often reactive. But what if we could automate part\nof that process using satellite imagery and Python?\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll walk through a real-world project that combines\ntransfer learning, PyTorch, and publicly available datasets to classify\nroad segment conditions (good, fair, poor) from aerial imagery. You'll\nlearn how to work with messy real-world geospatial data, fine-tune a\ndeep learning model using only a small training set (~2,000 examples),\nand overcome common challenges like blurry imagery, inconsistent labels,\nand overfitting.\n\nThis session is practical and code-driven, aimed at data scientists and\nanalysts working in mobility analytics, urban development, or\ninfrastructure who want to apply machine perception techniques in their\nwork. By the end, you\u2019ll walk away with a reusable workflow for\nanalyzing and predicting urban infrastructure quality \u2014 all using free\ntools and open data.\n",
