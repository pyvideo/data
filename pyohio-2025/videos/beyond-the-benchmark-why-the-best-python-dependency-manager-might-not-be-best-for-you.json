    "description": "**Ever wondered why your team still uses pip when benchmarks show\nalternatives are 10x faster?** The answer lies beyond raw performance\nmetrics.\n\nIn this myth-busting session, I'll reveal surprising insights from\nanalyzing thousands of GitHub repositories and real-world implementation\ncase studies. You'll discover why technical superiority doesn't always\ntranslate to organizational success, and how to navigate the complex\ndecision landscape of Python dependency management.\n\n| I'll share:\n| - \u26a1 Eye-opening performance comparisons between UV, Poetry, Conda,\n  and pip+pyenv\n| - \ud83d\udcca Actual adoption statistics that challenge conventional wisdom\n| - \ud83d\udcbc ROI calculations that factor in both technical AND human costs\n| - \ud83d\udee3\ufe0f A decision framework for selecting the right tool for YOUR\n  specific context\n\nWhether you're contemplating a migration, advocating for better tooling,\nor simply curious about the evolving Python ecosystem, you'll leave with\nactionable insights that balance technical excellence with\norganizational reality.\n\nDon't miss this data-driven exploration of Python's most\nunderappreciated infrastructure challenge!\n",
