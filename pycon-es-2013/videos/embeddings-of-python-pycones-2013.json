  "description": "Autor: James Powell\n\nTrack: Avanzado\n\nHow can Python be embedded into other applications (C/C++)? What bearing does this have on our conceptualisation of systems written in Python? This talk covers the very-high-level embedding and the pure-embedding and also includes two novel embeddings: a zero-interpreter embedding using Cython and a Python interpreter embedded as a extension model within another Python interpreter (the \"Xzibit\" embedding.) This is a talk I've given at PyData Boston and PyTexas. It's an advanced level talk around the ways we can embed Python into other (C/C++) applications. It includes two fairly novel results of my own research.\n",
