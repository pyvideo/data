  "description": "AI, SQL, and GraphQL Walk into a Fertility Clinic\u2026 LLM-based Medical feature development\n\nSession outline:\n\n1. Main challenges of doctors while working with patients' medical data in databases. \n\n2. Goals of \u201cchatting with my data\u201d feature for fertility clinics. \n\n3. Going with the audience step by step on the architecture flow of this kind of feature - showing each step in the flow, what is the input and output of each step, what are our main concerns in every step \n\n4. Sharing with the audience the solutions we discussed in our team to achieve the feature goals, and that are adequate to the feature flow. Presenting the pros and cons of each solution with respect to: security, flexibility in input and output, development time and cost, explainability and reliability of answers given back to the doctor. In this part I share a Python code that includes LLM-based chains for each of the solutions. I show how the code enables us to seamlessly test each of the solutions and compare them. The three solutions are: LLM+SQL, LLM+GraphQL and LLM+RestAPI. \n\n5. Discussing why we chose the \u201cGraphQL solution\u201d, how we implement it and present additional challenges in this development section (leaving some of them not solved yet\u2026 :)) \n\n6. Summary\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nDr. Shirli Di-Castro Shashua is a professional in machine learning and AI technologies.
