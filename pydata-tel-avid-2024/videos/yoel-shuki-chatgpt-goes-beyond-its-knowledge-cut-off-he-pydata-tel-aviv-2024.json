  "description": "Live Coding: ChatGPT Goes Beyond Its Knowledge Cut-Off With External Database Integration\n\nYou've all heard about ChatGPT, one of the most advanced language models out there \ud83e\udd16. Unfortunately, because the model was trained using the data available at its training time, it may not be aware of the most recent developments \ud83d\ude22\n\nJoin us for a live coding session, where we'll utilize TechCrunch as a source for up-to-date information \ud83d\uddde\ufe0f. We'll scrape it and embed the articles into a high-dimensional vector space. Now, when a user asks a question, instead of solely relying on ChatGPT\u2019s knowledge, we'll retrieve the most relevant item from the TechCrunch database (using vector similarity) and pass it to ChatGPT.\n\nFinally, one of the most advanced language models will advance to November 2024! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nShuki is a seasoned Data Scientist with an emphasis on NLP, classical ML, visualization, and experimentation.\nDriven by a great passion for the field, He is inspired by unintuitive insights and inferences made by smart algorithms. In his talks, he tries to convey my typical spirit and enthusiasm while delivering crisp takeaways.\n\nYoel has over 14 years of experience as a software engineer and algorithm developer in various domains, including NLP, recommender systems, vision, and cybersecurity.\nHe is passionate about good quality code, interesting ideas and sophisticated algorithms. He loves encountering elegant equations while trying to solve real-life problems.\n\n\nFollow PyData Tel Aviv on:\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/pydata-tlv\nhttps://www.facebook.com/PyDataTLV\nhttps://x.com/PyDataTLV\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
