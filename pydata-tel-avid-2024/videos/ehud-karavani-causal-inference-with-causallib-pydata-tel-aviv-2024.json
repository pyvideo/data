  "description": "Causal inference is the science of estimating the causal effects of actions using non-experimental data. \nIn this talk I will introduce causal inference, how it differs from the more familiar machine learning predictions, and why it is a harder task. I will present an overview of statistical models that can estimate causal effects, and I will present causallib - an open-source one-stop-shop Python package for flexible causal inference I created and maintain. \n\nThe main objective of the talk is to familiarize participants with the field of causal inference, increasing their awareness of the limitations in more common prediction models. A secondary objective is to present the tools that may help obtain causal inferences using a package which design corresponds with the scientific ecosystem in Python. \nThe talk is mainly aimed for data scientists familiar with machine learning, but group leaders may also benefit from understanding the limitations of regular prediction models and that they may be overcome.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nEhud is a research staff member at IBM Research, marrying machine learning with causal inference to address questions in medicine and healthcare.\nHe combines applied research with tool development for research, having created and currently maintaining Causallib\u2014an open-source Python package for flexible causal inference modeling\u2014used by many practitioners in both academia and industry. Over his 8 years at IBM, he has led the causality strategy for the company's global efforts in drug discovery, consulted to many of its research labs worldwide, lectured on causality to staff and clients, developed novel methodologies and published his research.\nHe holds an MSc. in computer science and computational biology from the Hebrew University, where he worked on trait prediction using DNA and assessed its potential consequences for population genetics and embryo selection.
