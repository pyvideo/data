  "description": "An introduction to solving combinatorial optimization and constraint satisfaction problems in Python. I will review the most popular libraries for SAT/CSP. We will then deep dive to a crash coarse on using Google's award winning OR-tools library, for efficiently solving some non-trivial real-world constrained combinatorial optimization problems.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nDr. Eyal Gruss - Code/media/text artist, algorithms researcher, teaches computational creativity at the Holon institute of Technology. https://eyalgruss.com\n\n\nFollow PyData Tel Aviv on:\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/pydata-tlv\nhttps://www.facebook.com/PyDataTLV\nhttps://x.com/PyDataTLV\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.",
