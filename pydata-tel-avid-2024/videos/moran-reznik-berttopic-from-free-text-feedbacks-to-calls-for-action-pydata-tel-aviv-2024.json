  "description": "This is a beginner level lecture, focused towards data analysts and product managers without string background in data science.\nWe\u2019ll start by describing the issue at hand: why traditional analysis tools are not good enough for free-text analysis tasks. Then we\u2019ll discuss how BertTopics works and show a minimal usage example in Python. We will dive into each of the stages of the process: embedding, clustering and dimensionality reduction and explore them.\nFinally, we\u2019ll show some results using interactive visualization.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n2019-2020 data science intern at CheckPoint\n2020-2022 data analyst at Ebay\n2022-2023 senior data analyst at Lusha\n\n\nFollow PyData Tel Aviv on:\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/pydata-tlv\nhttps://www.facebook.com/PyDataTLV\nhttps://x.com/PyDataTLV\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.",
