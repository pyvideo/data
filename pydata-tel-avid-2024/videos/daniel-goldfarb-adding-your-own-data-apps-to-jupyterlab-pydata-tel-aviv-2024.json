  "description": "JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.\n\nThis is a practical talk about how to extend JupyterLab. It is for anyone who finds themselves doing complex or repetitive tasks and thinks that they, and others, may benefit from integrating those tasks into JupyterLab; in other words, it is for anyone who wants to extend JupyterLab.\n\nWe will walk through a step-by-step example of creating and adding an extension application to JupyterLab. As we proceed, we will discuss and demonstrate the tools and infrastructure available for extending JupyterLab.  We'll learn, among other things, how to launch an app from different places within JupyterLab, how to style our app, and how to pass parameters to our app to modify its behavior.  \n\nAttendees will take away a clear understanding of how JupyterLab extensions work, and what steps to take to build their own extensions. The step-by-step example will also be made available in a GitHub repository with tags for checking out each step in the process.\n\nOutline:\n- Introduction and a brief description of some JupyterLab extensions\n- Building a basic extension\n   -- explanation of important files\n   -- basic principles of extension tools and infrastructure\n   -- installing and initializing our extension\n- Using the command registry\n- Executing from the Command Palette\n- Creating an app with widgets\n- Styling extensions in JupyterLab\n- Executing from the Launcher\n- Passing arguments to our application\n- Creating our own Sidebar launcher\n   -- Using event listeners to launch different versions of our app\n- Summary\n- Q&A \n\nRequired background knowledge: \n- Attendees should be familiar with Jupyter Notebooks. \n- Basic knowledge of any typical object oriented programming language is also required.\n- (familiarity with [JupyterLab](https://telaviv2023.pydata.org/cfp/talk/3JNZUQ/) is helpful but not required). \n\nRepository: https://github.com/DanielGoldfarb/pydjlx\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nDaniel is an engineer at [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/what-we-do/engineering-cto) with experience developing Trading Systems, Risk Analytics, and applications for Financial Analysis of Equities and Fixed Income securities. He holds a Ph.D. in Molecular Biophysics from the University of Virginia, and was a CFA charter holder and member of the Chartered Financial Analyst Institute for more than 10 years.
