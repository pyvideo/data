  "description": "Empowering ML Developers with Self Serve Data Analytics\n\nMobileye primarily focuses on algorithmic (ML/DL) development. Approximately 70% of our development time is dedicated to data-oriented tasks with large-scale data analysis being one of our major challenges. \nTo address this challenge, we've developed a solution that empowers developers to build data applications for large-scale data analysis using simple Python code which are then transformed into web dashboards.  \nWe will present our system architecture and SDK that facilitates the apps development while abstracting the complexity of both visualization and writing queries over big data framework.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nRoman Olshanskiy is with over 10 years of experience as a software engineer and leader in various domains, including backend, frontend, cloud computing, big data, and infrastructure, I am passionate about building innovative and efficient solutions, fostering collaboration, and bringing teams together to reach new heights.\n\nDavid Katz is a Software Engineer\u200b at Mobileye, specializing in self-service big data analytics platforms. \nWith extensive experience in big data engineering, he has a strong background in developing and optimizing large-scale data pipelines using Python, PySpark, and AWS.    \nDavid has also contributed to open-source projects in the Python data ecosystem.
