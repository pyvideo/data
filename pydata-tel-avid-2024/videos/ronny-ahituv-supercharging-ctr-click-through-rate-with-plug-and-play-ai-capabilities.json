  "description": "explore a fully AI-driven pipeline designed to boost click-through rates (CTR) using adaptable, off-the-shelf tools. The pipeline leverages:\nGenerative AI and genetic algorithms for creating diverse ad creatives.\nContextual multi-armed bandits to select the best creatives based on real-time data, powered by built-in regressors.\nARIMA models to capture and adjust for seasonal trends.\nMultimodal embeddings to efficiently handle and cluster high-cardinality features.\nThis session will demonstrate how integrating readily available AI solutions can help achieve more effective, streamlined CTR optimization.",
